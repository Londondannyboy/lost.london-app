Duelling Poets (with Michelle Gordon)INTRODUCTION  
For my two previous books on Lost London I was able to choose from the whole of central London. To go from  
that vast expanse to the small acreage of Thorney Island proved a bigger challenge than I was expecting, even  
though it is within walking distance of my own home. This was because of the huge amount of buried history  
in such a small space with events and people often overlapping with each other.  
An explanation on a metallic notice board in Parliament Square outside St Margaret’s Church introduces the  
name “Thorney Island” for those with good sight. It is the only public recognition of the name I have come  
across. It states at the beginning: “The origins of the area can be traced back to the end of the tenth century,  
when there was a small monastery on Thorney Island, near the site of the present Abbey”.  
The view from the notice board is the fading green grass of Parliament Square which was once the churchyard  
of St Margaret’s and its surrounding streets, until the streets were demolished in the 1780s. This was not very  
long after 1750 when the narrow Lindsay Lane (later called Dirty Lane), an historic link between Old Palace  
Yard and Millbank since at least 1593, was destroyed to make way for “improvements” associated with the  
new Westminster Bridge. This blasted a busy road between Westminster Abbey on one side and the Palace  
of Westminster on the other, thereby depriving the future World Heritage site of the unity of being in one  
uninterrupted place.  
There are only two books that I know of that include the word “Thorney” in the title. One is The Gem of Thorney  
Island by the Rev James Ridgway, written in 1860\. The other is the wonderfully detailed publication of the  
Museum of London, The royal palace and town of Westminster on Thorney Island based on archaeological  
excavations between 1991-98 for the Jubilee Line extension project.  
As with my other books, this one was researched, photographed and written with my mobile phone and iPad.  
The popularity of AI search engines will obviously change how books are written in the future. At present they  
are promising a bit more than they can deliver, but I was impressed enough to use an AI generated graphic for  
the chapter on George IV’s escape from his own Coronation banquet almost at the end of the book.  
This is very much a journalist’s book following avenues that took my fancy rather than a historical narrative. I  
hope you will enjoy.  
Vic Keegan1: Preface  
For much of its existence, the walled perimeter of the  
core of Thorney Island protected its rich inhabitants  
and its sheltered monks from the harsh realities of  
life. Barely a hundred yards away was what Charles  
Dickens popularised as “The Devil’s Acre” in the first  
edition of his weekly magazine, Household Words. It  
was arguably the most socially deprived and morally  
degraded area in the whole of Britain.  
Archaeologists and historians are still debating the  
exact course of the Tyburn and the extent to which  
Thorney Island was formed by the Tyburn (now  
flowing in a sewer under Great College Street) and  
the Thames, or whether Thorney was just a tidal island  
in the Thames. Either way, there is no doubt that it  
existed even though it is little known.  
Little known? When I eventually joined the Thorney  
Island Society, I was pleasantly surprised to be able to  
visit buildings in the area to which the Society was given  
access, but which normally were difficult for members  
of the public to gain entry to. On one such occasion  
we were taken through the Houses of Parliament to see  
the private rooms of the Speaker. Halfway through,  
our leader \- an official House of Commons guide \- took  
me aside and whispered: “Excuse me for asking, but  
where exactly is Thorney Island?” I didn’t say a word  
but just pointed downwards with my finger.  
Old Pye Street, named after Sir Robert Pye, a croney  
of Oliver Cromwell) was the epicentre of the Devil’s  
Acre. The concept of Fagin’s Den in Dickens’s Oliver  
Twist is almost certainly based on an actual school  
for pickpockets located in a pub called The One Tun  
in Perkins Rents off Old Pye Street. That school was  
eventually reformed by philanthropists who moved it to  
the building where the Thorney Island’s small Archive  
is today. There is a plaque behind the building to  
commemorate this fact.  
On the other side of the tiny lane is the flourishing St  
Andrew’s Club which claims to be the oldest youth  
club in the world. It is on the site of a house where  
Henry Purcell, the great composer, was raised and  
in the same street where Robert “Gather ye rosebuds  
while ye may” Herrick also lived. It is difficult to move  
anywhere in this area without treading on history.  
The Thorney Island Society was formed by a  
remarkable woman, June Stubbs, and her co-founder,  
Ann Carlton. They took on the powerful property  
corporation Land Securities which in 1985 was about  
to demolish London’s oldest library in Great Smith  
Street and indeed the whole of one side of the street.  
June Stubbs won, and the building was saved though  
the library itself had already moved elsewhere. It is  
now the fashionable Cinnamon Club restaurant which  
has preserved the ethos of the library inside.  
This book is, emphatically, not an exhaustive history  
of the area which has been well covered elsewhere.  
Westminster Abbey alone has had more books written  
about it than any other church. To write about the  
politics would take a lifetime. Inevitably, there are  
small duplications of people and events in such a  
small area. Like my previous books (Vic Keegan’s Lost  
London (1) and (2)) this book is about the people and  
places that take my fancy.  
Years ago, when working for the Guardian, I would  
occasionally take a short cut along a thoroughfare in  
Westminster called Old Pye Street. On the side of the  
road on the corner of St Ann’s Lane there was a tiny  
building that was home to an outfit called The Thorney  
Island Society (and Friends of St James’s and the  
Green Park). I presumed it to be a pleasantly eccentric  
organisation as I knew of no islands nearby apart  
from the one I was standing on formed by England,  
Scotland and Wales.  
It was only after retirement that I stopped to read what  
it was all about. It turned out there was, and indeed  
still is, an island in the centre of London. Formed, it  
is claimed, by the junction of the Tyburn river \- now  
running underground in the sewage system \- with the  
Thames.  
Houses of Parliament, Westminster School and until  
the fire of 1834, nearly all of the major law courts  
before they moved to the Strand, not to mention the  
predecessor of Big Ben. For 500 years it was also the  
site of the main Royal Palace from where England and  
sometimes Britain was ruled. Some of the remains are  
still on view.  
Most of Thorney Island is covered by buildings and  
a road that runs from Parliament Square to Millbank.  
This means that you can’t walk anywhere on these  
few acres without treading on the actual footsteps of  
the famous and the infamous, from Oliver Cromwell to  
William Shakespeare and also the most powerful and  
the most weak. It is surely the densest concentration of  
“history” in such a small area to be found anywhere  
\- yet hardly anyone knows about it including many of  
those who work there.  
Thorney Island has history on its side. It is the site  
of a former monastery, Westminster Abbey, the two  
2 32: Whatever happened to the River Tyburn?  
What could have been a major tourist attraction for  
London is now buried underground \- its rivers. There  
are four north of the Thames \- the Fleet, the Westbourne,  
the Tyburn and the Walbrook, and two south of the  
river \- the Effra and the Neckinger. If you want to know  
what they could have looked like today had they not  
been cemented over, then go to Wandsworth and walk  
the Wandle, a river once one of the most polluted in  
the world, but which has been restored by volunteers  
to become once again, at the time of writing, a chalk  
stream in near pristine condition.  
The other rivers can’t be seen, but can occasionally  
be heard. If you stand outside The Coach gastropub  
in Ray Street, Clerkenwell, you can listen to the Fleet  
flowing underneath the pavement from a drain. The  
Tyburn can be heard through one or two drains in  
Tachbrook Street, Victoria, but they are in the middle  
of the road making it hazardous to investigate.  
The Westbourne can’t be seen except as a tubular  
channel running above a platform at Sloane Square  
underground station. The Neckinger runs underground  
though traces of it may be seen where it meets the  
Thames at St Saviour’s Dock.  
The actual routes of these rivers have been well  
established, except for one: the Tyburn. Historians  
and archaeologists are agreed that the first leg of its  
journey went from the Hampstead Hills to Buckingham  
Palace (albeit hidden from view by the sewer system)  
but thereafter the river divides… and so do the experts.  
Let’s take the agreed bit first. The name Tyburn derives  
from the Anglo Saxon word Teoburne or Teo-burna  
It is possible to follow the meanderings of the original  
Tyburn along the narrow streets of Mayfair that it  
flowed along. There won’t be any water underneath  
the exact spots any more because when Sir Joseph  
Bazalgette constructed over 80 miles of sewers under  
London he had to locate them at some distance from  
the actual rivers so the water could be diverted when  
the sewers were finished.  
After Mayfair, the Tyburn flows under Piccadilly \-  
where in around 1700 at number 100 there was  
once a very successful “water theatre” powered by  
Fig 1\. The Tyburn bifurcates at Buckingham Palace, one leg going to  
near Vauxhall Bridge and the other around Thorney Island and nearby  
Thorney Street  
meaning “boundary stream” or a stream separating  
various boundaries as the Tyburn did in the Middle  
Ages between the manors of Westminster and Chelsea.  
It rises from a few sources including Shepherd’s Well  
in the Hampstead Hills and flows underground in a  
pipe under the Chalbert bridge into Regents Park.  
It carries on under Oxford Street into Mayfair. In the  
early 13th century the Grand Conduit was built from  
Oxford Street (by Bond Street) to divert much of its  
waters to Cheapside in the City of London which  
would have significantly reduced its normal flow to  
the Thames.  
The Chalbert bridge in Regents Park  
the Tyburn \- and then into The Green Park, where the  
contours of the original river can still be discerned.  
The sound of the Tyburn or a tributary running along  
one of the sewers can be heard down a drain along  
one of the pathways in the photo above.  
Source of the Tyburn  
4 5It then continues across Victoria Street to flow under  
King’s Scholar’s Passage (Fig 4\) to where it meets the  
end of Francis Street and Vauxhall Bridge Road. It is  
called King’s Scholars’ Passage because in medieval  
times the scholars of Westminster public school  
were allowed to bathe there. There won’t be any  
opportunities to do that in future though there have  
been suggestions from time to time that part of it might  
be glassed over to reveal a bit of history.  
After crossing the Vauxhall Bridge Road, the sewer then  
journeys under Tachbrook Street towards its historic  
outlet by the Thames at Grosvenor Road. There are a  
couple of drain holes in the middle of Tachbrook Street  
where what remains of the Tyburn can be heard, but  
as they are in the middle of an often busy street it is  
not advisable to do so unless you are very careful.  
At the end of its trek a few hundred yards west of  
Vauxhall Bridge (Fig 5\) there is a plaque on the river  
wall next to what used to be the sluice gate controlling  
the flow of water. These days most of the flow is diverted  
by interceptor channels towards treatment works in the  
East End but on stormy days when Bazalgette’s 150

on the left). Its route went down Palace Street past  
the St James Theatre to the Cardinal Place entrance  
to Victoria tube station. An aerial photo taken by the  
constructors of the new entrance to the station (Fig 3\)  
offers a rare example of the actual Tyburn (circled in  
yellow), still part of the sewer system, in full flow.  
The Victoria Palace theatre is to the left and Victoria  
Street at the foot of the picture. When you descend  
into Victoria station from here you will be walking  
under the Tyburn.  
Sounds of water under a manhole in The Green Park  
This (Fig 2\) is a glimpse of the Tyburn sewer under The  
Green Park looking south towards Buckingham Palace.  
It is a good example of the amazing brickwork still  
intact after more than 150 years. On the right, at least  
one of the connecting tunnels will be an interceptor  
taking surplus water \- including sewage \- down to  
treatment works in the East End.  
The map (Fig 1\) shows the alternative \- or complementary  
\- routes of the Tyburn from Buckingham Palace. It is  
generally agreed that one leg goes from Buckingham  
Palace to west of Vauxhall Bridge (following the arrows  
Fig 4\. King’s Scholars’ Passage from near Victoria Street to Vauxhall  
Bridge Road  
What’s left of the Tyburn river flows along Tachbrook Street to the Thames  
year old sewer system can’t cope, the Tyburn empties  
its unforgiving flow into the Thames, sewage and all.  
You can still see the sluice gate keeper’s house, now  
converted into a des-res called Tyburn House close by  
the exit.  
This ends the undisputed course of the Tyburn from  
the Hampstead Hills via Buckingham Palace to near  
Vauxhall Bridge. The big question is did it also flow  
from Buckingham Palace to Old Westminster, aka  
Thorney Island?  
This is controversial. Experts such as archaeologists  
Fig 3\. The Tyburn (in a sewer) at Cardinal Place, Victoria Station  
(Constructor’s photo)  
6 7It is water from the Tyburn but not, it is argued, the  
traditional channel of the Tyburn itself.  
Donovan argues that it is unusual for a river such as  
the Tyburn to divide into two branches near its mouth  
However, another group of distinguished archaeologists  
including Mary Nicholls, head of Environmental  
Archaeology at Museum of London Archaeology  
(MOLA), thinks otherwise. They and others have sunk  
numerous boreholes along the surrounding areas of  
Thorney Island. If you look carefully at the map of  
the Tyburn (Fig 1 the boreholes are represented by  
seen in the photo (Fig 7\) which shows the storm water  
channel, which historically, has deposited surplus  
storm water into the Thames when the sewers can’t  
cope and to the right of which are the Thorney steps  
which give access to the foreshore subject to fast  
moving tides and often slippery steps. Lambeth Bridge  
is in the background.  
tiny crosses. They argue that many years ago there  
were deep channels that would have been a natural  
carrier of the waters of the Tyburn to form a delta-like  
formation \- yes, a delta \- in the broad area around  
Thorney Island. This would have created a number of  
eyots or small islands of which Thorney was likely the  
biggest.  
They found that both the northern and southern  
Tyburn branches were mainly characterised by deep  
channels which would have been a natural route for  
water. Where data points (the locations of heights  
derived from borehole logs) are numerous – for  
Fig 5\. The sluice gate near Vauxhall Bridge where the Tyburn meets the  
Thames  
Tim Tatton Brown and Desmond Donovan argue that  
the route from Buckingham Palace to Vauxhall was  
the natural and only course of the Tyburn and that the  
only way it flowed from the site of today’s Buckingham  
Palace to Thorney Island was because there was a  
man-made channel in the 1080s built on the instruction  
of the monks of Westminster Abbey to convey water  
to flush out their latrines. The 1080s channel was  
probably used for the 13th century Abbey mill,  
according to Tatton Brown, but not for the later mill  
of 1530 which had a pond behind the “Millbank”,  
hence the name.  
This means that water from the Tyburn would have  
reached Thorney Island, but as a result of a diversion.  
A fragment of the late medieval great drain (Courtesy, Tim Tatton Brown)  
and “there is no question of a delta” so an artificial  
channel is a likely explanation and medieval Thorney  
island appears to have been ”an island in the tidal  
Thames”.  
This view is similar to the conclusion of the Rev James  
Ridgway, the author of The Gem of Thorney Island,  
published in 1860\. He argued that Thorney Island  
“was formed by a small branch of the Thames which  
leaving that river at the end of Abingdon Street ran in  
a westerly direction along the line of College Street  
and the south side of Dean‘s Yard. After crossing  
Tothill Street it continued its course along Princes  
Street which until recently retained its name of Long  
Ditch. From there it ran in an easterly direction  
along Gardeners Lane, crossing King Street (today’s  
Whitehall), Parliament Street, and Cannon Row and  
returned to the river near the southern extremity of the  
privy Gardens”.example around Thorney Island – the model shows  
deep channels, between \-2m and 6m \- OD at the base  
of the channel. The reference “-6m OD” indicates that  
a location is 6 meters below the Ordnance Datum  
(OD) a UK reference point for measuring altitudes and  
heights based on mean sea level.  
The team concludes: “Given the evident depth and  
definition of the channels in the lower Tyburn reach,  
a man-made origin for the northern branch (going to  
Fig 6\. The Tyburn’s possible route to the Thames under Great College  
Street  
Thorney Island) seems implausible”. They add that the  
contour plot shows the northern branch of the Tyburn  
Who is right? This debate seems bound to go and  
splitting to encircle Thorney Island. This meant that  
on between archaeologists who have established the  
the Tyburn on one side flowed around Thorney Island  
existence of a channel made by the monks and the  
reaching the Thames by following the path of the  
painstakingly researched MOLA conclusion that the  
medieval monastery wall along Great College Street  
flow of the Tyburn in deep channels had a Delta effect  
(Fig 6 at the end of which it powered the monks’ mill  
creating a number of eyots including Thorney Island  
which led to the road being called Millbank.  
which survived to become part of a UNESCO World  
An additional channel split off to the south to join  
Heritage site at Westminster. It is possible they are  
the Thames around today’s Thorney Street as can be  
both right as the authoritative research by the Museum  
8 93: The Gatehouse to Heaven \- or to Hell  
Fig 7\. The outlet near Thorney Street on the Embankment near Tate Britain  
of London with its deep channels refers to a much  
earlier period when the post glacier template would  
have shaped the landscape. After this period streams  
and channels would have silted up from the Neolithic  
(4.000 to 2,t00 BCE \- Before Common Era-), onwards  
producing remnant streams which the monks may  
have eventually cut through. Either way, water from  
the Tyburn would have reached Thorney Island thanks  
to either man or Nature. Or both.  
What the convergence of the Tyburn and the Thames might have looked  
like according to Museum of London archaeologists’ research (enhanced  
from MOLA original)  
The ruined Gatehouse in 1776 looking from outside the Abbey towards Tothill Street  
Anyone who walked through this gatehouse, built  
in 1327, from the end of Tothill Street (seen through  
the archway) into the main entrance to Westminster  
Abbey and the heart of Thorney Island, would have  
got quite a shock. For a start it was not just a gateway  
to the House of God, it was a prison as well. In fact,  
there were two prisons, separate but joined together  
straddling the road. One for the clergy run by the  
church and the other for run-of-the-mill criminals. You  
would also have come across a third prison pretty  
soon after, in the churchyard of St Margaret’s. There  
was a watch house to guard the church, where felons  
10 11could be kept overnight before being interrogated in  
the morning.  
All this must have seemed to some visitors as a  
gateway to Hell, not Heaven. In a sense it was true,  
because at the eastern side of the Precinct running  
along the wall of Westminster Hall were two taverns  
called Heaven and Hell, and a third called Purgatory  
and a fourth, called Paradise. Most of these taverns  
had been used in their time as prisons, mainly for  
debtors. That is at least six prisons in all. The Norden  
map of 1593 (Fig 8\) doesn’t show the taverns but was  
the Westminster Shakespeare would have known.  
The road immediately outside the Gatehouse was a  
curved one hugging the outside of the perimeter wall  
which protected the Abbey and the monastery from  
the outside world. It was called Thieving Lane (E) not  
because it was full of thieves, but because it was the  
route taken to escort new inmates to the Gatehouse  
prison so they couldn’t escape and claim “Sanctuary”  
in the Abbey precinct.  
Sanctuary was an historic practice going back to  
Saxon times, strongly endorsed by King Edward the  
Confessor in the eleventh century. It meant that felons  
of all kinds could claim sanctuary and be protected  
from arrest.  
As a result, the precinct became home to dozens of  
criminals claiming sanctuary in addition to all the  
tradespeople and other local inhabitants who lived  
there. It was completely different from the idealised  
view of Thorney Island often portrayed in engravings.  
In its latter years, the Gatehouse building was just  
a debtors’ prison. We learn from Mr. Mackenzie  
Walcott’s Memorials of Westminster that the debtors  
“used to let down an alms-box, extended on a pole  
forty feet long, in order to collect the benevolences of  
passers-by. They were allowed to buy spirits; and the  
keeper used to shout from his window to the barman  
of the neighbouring tavern The Angel, saying: “Jack-  
ass, jack-ass” thereby signifying the thirst of the  
prisoners.  
The proceedings at the Old Bailey \- available online  
\- have lots of references to inmates of the Gatehouse.  
They include William Cook, a local resident of St  
Margaret’s parish who was executed for counterfeiting  
the coinage, and John Broccas, believe it or not, the  
Keeper of The Gatehouse itself, who was accused  
of High Treason and committed to the King’s Bench  
prison in Southwark. This was because he permitted  
a Captain William Legg who was imprisoned by  
Parliament for high treason (“levying war against the  
King”) to escape in October 1642 to rejoin Charles  
l’s army in Oxford.  
The Gatehouse was eventually demolished in 1776,  
following complaints by Dr Johnson and others.  
He said that “it was so offensive that, without any  
particular reason, it ought to be pulled down, for it  
disgraces the present magnificence of the capital,  
and is a continual nuisance to its neighbours and  
passengers”.  
A fascinating thing about the Gatehouse is that,  
despite being a horrendous prison for hundreds of  
years, it is mainly remembered today because of two  
poems written there. One was by Richard Lovelace, a  
Cavalier poet, and the other by Sir Walter Raleigh the  
great Elizabethan courtier, historian and buccaneer.  
Lovelace, who was in prison for trying to get rid of  
View of the Abbey from Tothill Street  
the Clergy Act of 1640 (which banned bishops and  
others from having any power in Parliament), wrote a  
poem to his lover, Althea, including these memorable  
lines:  
Stone walls do not a prison make  
Nor iron bars a cage;  
Mindes innocent and quiet take

bigger than the etching suggests). In mid photo a second Gatehouse is

Wyngarde in 1542  
And in my soule am free,  
Angels alone that sore above

It was here too, that Sir Walter Raleigh, suspected of  
trying to overthrow James l, penned his last poem, or  
maybe finished an earlier one, on the final night of  
his life before his execution around the corner in Old  
Palace Yard on October 29, 1618\. It ended:  
E’en such is Time\! that takes on trust  
Our youth, our joys, our all we have,  
And pays us but with age and dust;  
Who in the dark and silent grave,  
When we have wandered all our ways,  
Shuts up the story of our days.\!  
And from which grave, and earth and dust,  
The Lord shall raise me up, I trust.  
In the morning, Raleigh was taken to Old Palace Yard  
where he was executed as a traitor and then, bizarrely,  
treated as a hero by being buried back around the  
corner under the main altar in St Margaret’s church.  
Among other later alumni of the Gatehouse was  
Samuel Pepys, who spent three weeks there in 1690  
on suspicion of “being affected” to the exiled royalist  
and in 1776 an order was made by the Dean and  
Chapter, for its demolition.  
Its remaining inmates were removed from the  
Gatehouse to the Bridewell House of Correction, which  
was originally built in 1618 at the other end of today’s  
Victoria Street (by the site of today’s Greencoat Boy  
pub in Greencoat Place). The Gatehouse had survived  
for 406 years. The Bridewell lasted until 1834 when  
a new, much larger prison was built on the site where  
Westminster Cathedral is today.  
It is a curious fact that a small part of the 17th century  
Bridewell prison \- to which prisoners of the Gatehouse  
were moved after its closure \- has found its way back  
to Thorney Island. If you look at the back wall of the  
Supreme Court there is a stone entrance that goes  
nowhere. It was one of the entrances to the Bridewell  
and was rescued by the Greater London Council in  
1969 and placed at the back of what was then the  
Assizes before it became the Supreme Court. It could  
be viewed as a kind of installation art \- a reminder of  
how this small part of London changed from a place  
where felons came to escape the law, to where ultimate  
justice is meted out from which there is no escape.  
Unless, of course, it becomes a sanctuary again.  
King James ll.  
It seems bizarre to us today that the Abbey could have  
been associated with such a decrepit prison at the  
edge of the Sanctuary, but the monks were insulated  
from the strife. They enjoyed quite a good life inside  
the monastery with supplies of fresh(ish) food and,  
judging by archaeological discoveries, a good diet  
of fish and occasional meat. The Gate House Prison  
was held on a lease by an individual from the Dean  
and Chapter. The keeper could keep any fees he  
charged. He was responsible for the safekeeping  
of his prisoners, and also for the behaviour of the  
warders. It was in effect privatised. By the middle of  
The entrance to the Bridewell House of Correction now at the rear of the Supreme Courtthe 18th century, the building was in serious decay  
14 154: The magic of medieval Westminster  
is where the buildings of Westminster Abbey and the  
Houses of Parliament are located.  
For 500 years from King Cnut’s first palace, until  
around 1518, it was the main royal residence until  
a fire prompted Henry Vlll to move and expand  
his palatial residence into what we know today as  
Whitehall. It was on Thorney (Island) that Parliament  
emerged from being a plaything of the monarch to a  
role model for the English speaking world, and where  
a modest monastery became Westminster Abbey  
where every monarch since William the Conqueror  
has been crowned (and one, Edward V, actually born  
there). It was here where Westminster School changed  
from a charity to a fee paying school producing  
alumni that included Christopher Wren, Isaac Newton  
and Ben Jonson. Less celebrated is that for nearly 700  
years virtually all of our law courts were housed in  
Westminster Hall and our system of law was exported  
to most of our colonies including the United States.  
Today Thorney Island is almost completely unknown  
to the general public who pass over it daily in their  
thousands, because the Tyburn, like all the rivers that  
once graced the heart of London, has been buried  
beneath Sir Joseph Bazalgette’s life-saving sewer  
system; but the waters of the Tyburn still roll quietly  
on. If, for instance, you walk along Great College  
Street today close to Parliament Square, you are  
likely walking above part of the Tyburn, now a sewer,  
though this is still disputed among archaeologists.  
No-one doubts it was an island. The question is  
whether it was formed just by the tidal Thames or  
the conjunction of the Thames and Tyburn. It once  
powered the monks’ water mill, hence the name  
Millbank, before emptying its waters into the Thames.  
Today, those waters are diverted to East End treatment  
works. (Thank you, Sir Joseph).  
Thorney Island isn’t an officially designated area.  
Archaeologists and historians are still arguing about  
its dimensions but its boundary appears to have  
expanded from its central core around the Abbey as  
far as Horseferry Road where the Sanctuary of the  
Abbey ended. The picture at the top of this chapter is  
a romanticised vision of what it looked like in medieval  
times. The river probably looked more like a delta with  
waters spilling out all over the place, forming lots of  
smaller islands or eyots.

It has never been a legal entity, let alone a postcode,  
surrounded by smaller islands; well over 5,000 of  
and the name was used to describe a wider area  
them. The least well known, yet the most important, is  
than the core island itself. It was arguably formed by  
right in the heart of London at Westminster. It is called  
the convergence of the River Tyburn with the Thames  
Thorney Island (or Thornea or Torneia or Thornige).  
though you can’t see it anymore as the Tyburn is now

The first depiction of Westminster Abbey is on the Bayeux Tapestry c107016 17The origin of Thorney Island can be traced back  
nearly 3,000 years when global sea levels started  
to subside. They had previously risen 15 metres as a  
result of a mega-event when the glaciers melted. That  
phenomenon had raised sea levels across the planet.  
Lower levels eventually enabled the Thames, flowing  
gently from a spring in Oxfordshire, to converge with  
the Tyburn meandering down from the Hampstead  
Hills as it still does today, albeit unseen. That, at least,  
is one version.  
Lower sea levels revealed small islands or eyots  
along the Thames, of which, Thorney was probably  
the largest. It was composed of compacted sand and  
gravel sitting on a bed of London clay.  
The Tyburn still exists today though its actual course  
is an ongoing subject for academic debate as a later  
chapter explains. Much of the original river gets  
diverted by interceptor channels along the route from  
the Hampstead hills which redirect its flow to the east  
end of London to treatment works.  
However, in stormy weather the interceptors can’t cope  
and the Tyburn overflows to reach the Thames again  
through emergency exits. It is still an open question  
how much of the source waters of the Tyburn actually  
reach Thorney these days, after so much has been  
ferried away to treatment works. One way to solve  
this would be to put an enormous amount of dye at the  
source in the Hampstead hills and wait to see where it  
comes out. If only . . .  
How long has it been known as Thorney Island?  
The Museum of London Archaeological Society’s  
Monograph 22 (written after it had done extensive  
archeological work prior to the construction of the  
Jubilee Line) states that “it became known in the 8th  
century as Thorney Island”.  
This is probably based on a charter of Westminster  
Abbey attributed to King Offa in 785 AD which referred  
to a monastery at Torneia (Thorney) “in the terrible  
place (in loco terriblis) called Westminster”. However,  
this is now accepted by the Abbey as a forgery made  
Westminster Abbey by Wenceslaus Hollar (1607-1677)  
later around 1150 at a time when forgery was a  
bit of a hobby among the monks wanting to prove  
ownership of land they thought should be theirs, but to  
which there was no accessible title. If nothing else, this  
suggests that the word Torneia, or something similar,  
was in circulation in 1150 and maybe much earlier.  
One of the earliest references in print to Thorney  
Island was in William of Malmesbury’s Gesta Regum  
Anglorum (“Deeds of the Kings of the English”),  
circulated in the early 12th century. The Latin text  
has been translated as “in the marshy place, which  
is called Thornige (Latin for Thorney), King Edward  
chose this island to lay the foundation of an abbot and  
minster there…”  
What is certain, according to Westminster Abbey  
records, is that in about 785 there was a small  
community of monks on the island, whatever it was  
called, and that the monastery was enlarged and  
remodeled after 960 by Saint Dunstan who had  
become Bishop of London the previous year. St Dunstan  
founded the monastery, probably on the remains of an  
earlier church with the help of a vast estate of up to  
2,500 acres on the north side of the Thames between  
the Tyburn and the Fleet which was given to the monks  
by King Edgar. It effectively covered much of the city  
of Westminster. It became a Benedictine abbey in the  
990s.  
In 1016, King Cnut is believed to have been the  
first monarch to build a palace at Westminster, but  
the original Abbey owes its origin to (St) Edward the  
Confessor who built both a palace and a much larger  
Abbey later in the11th century. He didn’t live to enjoy  
it as he died in December 1065, and had been too ill  
to attend the consecration a few days earlier. Henry  
lll later rebuilt it into what it looks like now. Only a  
few of the foundations of the Confessor’s Abbey have  
survived until today.  
Westminster Abbey, or to give it its proper name, The  
Collegiate College of St Peter, is a mesmeric church,  
but also a flourishing business thanks to booming  
tourism which accounts for well over 90% of its income.  
The Abbey has not only crowned all monarchs since  
1066, it also memorialises hundreds of scientists,  
aristocrats, authors, actors and other dignitaries within  
its walls.  
It may seem odd that the House of God charges to get  
in (£30 at the time of writing) while Mammon, in the  
shape of the nearby Tate Britain, has free entry. The  
harsh reality is that the Abbey needs all the money  
it can get to meet the enormous cost of maintaining  
its structure. As a “royal peculiar” owing allegiance  
to the Crown rather than the Government, it gets no  
public money while Tate Britain nearby, thankfully,  
enjoys a government subsidy.  
Most of the medieval buildings are long gone and the  
remains of others are hidden from public view but one  
\- the Jewel Tower \- can still be seen. You don’t have  
to believe that the Island was founded by the mystical  
appearance of St Peter, as earlier stories claimed, to  
accept that there is something rather magical about  
it. If there is any place in Britain or even Europe with  
such a wealth of history in such a small space, it has  
yet to reveal itself.  
18 195: The Criminal History of the  
Supreme Court  
This drawing is all we have left of Westminster’s  
mighty 60 feet high and 75 feet square Belfry whose  
bells rang for over 300 years until about 1750\. It  
was situated where the Supreme Court is today in  
Parliament Square. Built by Edward III (1312-1377),  
for a time it contained the bells of Westminster Abbey  
until they were moved to the western towers of the  
Abbey by Christopher Wren or his assistant Nicholas  
Hawksmoor. If you were entering the Abbey precinct  
through the Gate House at the end of Tothill Street, the  
Belfry would have been the dominant building about  
50 yards on your left.  
When in full swing its three great bells were so  
loud that, according to the historian John Stow, they  
“sowred all the drinke in the towne.”  
Morgan’s 1592 map. The Bell Tower in red. Tuthill (Tothill) street is there today  
The Supreme Court is the ultimate Court of Appeal  
to ensure that justice is done.Yet for 400 years the  
opposite was the case. The Belfry or Bell Tower on  
this site was regarded as the heart of the “Sanctuary”  
of Westminster Abbey, a place where felons could  
escape the arm of the law as long as they confessed  
their wrongdoing. Not even the monarch could ignore  
this right of sanctuary which was firmly established by  
King (or St) Edward the Confessor in the 11th century,  
though the origin was much earlier in Saxon times.  
The area of sanctuary, technically, extended way  
beyond the walled precincts of the Abbey. It included  
much of today’s Parliament Square and extended  
right down to Strutton Ground and Horseferry Road,  
though it must have been very difficult to police it at  
that distance. Although the core of Thorney Island was  
the centre of Old Westminster, the wider definition  
probably followed the contours of the Sanctuary.  
Tim Tatton Brown in his contribution to the book  
Fig 9of the Royal Abbey and Palace, suggests that this  
wider area may have marked the late Anglo-Saxon  
boundary of the Monastery’s land. He adds: “It is  
even possible that this larger area, with the Royal Vill  
(an administrative center shared between the royal  
court and local people) and its vast new Abbey church  
in the north east corner, was the original “Thorney  
Island”.  
Most abbeys had sanctuaries. The one on Thorney  
Island was bigger than most and lasted until James I  
finally abolished it. However, the culture of criminality  
that it created lasted for centuries afterwards. It didn’t  
disappear, it just moved nearby which was why the  
area behind today’s Victoria Street was so ridden  
with crime and prostitution that it became known as  
“The Devil’s Acre”, a phrase popularised by Charles  
Dickens. (See Chapter 27 Devils Acre).  
There are hardly any reproductions of the Bell Tower,  
except for a sketch (Fig 9\) made by William Stukely,  
Westminster – the Art, Architecture and Archaeology  
20 21an eminent archeologist who rushed to record it when  
the building was being demolished. He wrote: “On  
November 14, 1750, I went to survey the old church  
at Westminster called The Sanctuary which they were  
then pulling down to make a new market house. The  
building itself is as extraordinary in its kind, as that  
we have no clear account concerning it in the history  
of Westminster Abbey to which it manifestly belongs.”  
It had only one door and one window on the ground  
floor, but two chapels on different floors where  
refugees could hear mass and hopefully put themselves  
on the road to redemption. Its history is preserved in  
today’s street names such as The Sanctuary and Little  
Sanctuary, which meander around the side of the  
Supreme Court.  
Fig 10\. The bell tower at Salisbury Cathedral is similar to the one that  
was on Thorney Island. (Wenceslaus Hollar (1607-1677)  
The Supreme Court stands on the remains of two  
previous Guildhall buildings dating to the early and  
late 19th centuries. Foundations of the medieval  
structure and earlier Saxon remains were uncovered  
by archaeologists in 1912\. Some believe that more  
remains might be waiting to be discovered. This seems  
unlikely in view of the depth of the building, but there  
may be some nearby. It is not a well known fact, but  
the Court has a pleasant café in the basement which  
is open to the public as is the Court itself when it is in  
session.  
What the engraving does not show is that above it  
there would have been three other layers including  
a bell tower and a spire. It was apparently similar to  
a tower at Salisbury Cathedral of which there is an  
engraving (Fig 10). This was executed by the great  
Czech artist Wenceslaus Hollar, who, as it happens,  
was a resident of Thorney Island in Gardener Street.  
He died there in 1677 in such poverty that he had to  
beg the bailiffs not to take his bed before he died. He  
was buried in the churchyard of St Margaret’s Church.  
The Bell Tower was built as a fortress with thick walls  
to resist possible attack. There were also bells in the  
cloisters of nearby St Stephen’s Chapel dating from  
even earlier times and also at St Margaret’s Church  
adjacent to the Abbey, not to mention the Clock Tower  
in New Palace Yard which housed the predecessor of  
Big Ben. Bells, bells everywhere.  
The belfry, or a part of it, was afterwards converted  
into a tavern called The Three Tuns with its vaults  
serving as a wine-cellar. It was also called The  
Castle at some stage. The building was demolished  
around 1750, and on part of its site a meat-market  
was built. The market was later removed and in its  
place the Middlesex Guildhall, or Sessions House was  
constructed.  
Today, its successor, the Supreme Court, stands  
confidently on the site of the Belfry from where it  
administers final judgment. But it can’t escape its  
history. It stands on the remains of the lawless Bell  
Tower where criminals could escape justice. What  
it must have been like to live in this extraordinary  
fusion of religion and wildlife can only be imagined.  
However, ordinary life somehow went on.  
And where there is ordinary life, it would have been  
no surprise to find Samuel Pepys whose diary recorded  
a number of visits to Westminster, not least when he  
married his wife Elizabeth in a civil ceremony on  
December 1, 1655 in St Margaret’s Church.  
Pepys lived in nearby Axe Yard for a short period  
and was a frequent visitor to the area as Secretary of  
the Admiralty and also as MP for Harwich. He was  
imprisoned for a time in the Gatehouse Prison under  
suspicion of Jacobinism and on 3rd August 1660  
he recalled that he had dined in a curiously named  
tavern known as the Quaker’s Tavern in the Great  
Sanctuary because it had been leased by the Dean  
and Chapter to a man known as a Quaker who sold  
wine in draught. It may well have been the Three Tuns  
under a nickname.  
At the back of the Supreme Court building in Little  
Sanctuary today you will find the stone doorway to the  
Tothill Fields Bridewell prison which used to be at the  
other end of Victoria Street next to today’s Greencoat  
pub (where Artillery Row meets Greycoat Place).  
The doorway was moved to this site by the Greater  
London Council in 1969\. What happened to the rest  
of the prison is not known. The doorway could be  
regarded as a piece of installation art, an unintended  
reminder to the Supreme Court of its criminal history.  
Felons who pass through a gateway to a prison might  
well find their case ends up in the Supreme Court.  
If the sanctuary existed today, you could be sure that  
The gateway to Tothill Street prison in Little Sanctuary  
immigrants in fear of being deported would make a  
beeline for it and, if the laws of the day were observed,  
not even the courts could have done anything about  
it. One can’t escape the irony of the Supreme court,  
the pinnacle of English justice, being on the site of a  
sanctuary where you could have escaped justice with  
the entrance to a prison now tacked on to it.  
22 236: How Green’s Alley started a beer  
revolution  
Green’s Alley, situated in  
the medieval precinct of  
Westminster Abbey, must be  
one of the least known lanes in  
London’s history, yet it marked  
the birth of what eventually  
became one of the biggest  
drinks companies on the planet.  
It is usually mentioned on maps  
by a number and only rarely, as  
in the Rocque map of 1746 (Fig  
11), is it given the courtesy of an  
actual name. In this patch of the  
Broad Sanctuary, the Greens (or  
Greenes), after whom the alley  
was presumably named, had a  
brewhouse with associated inns  
in the Sanctuary and in nearby  
King Street (today’s Whitehall)  
as far back as the early 1400s.  
What makes this unusual is that it is possible to trace  
the corporate DNA of Diageo, one of the world’s  
largest drinks companies, to the Greens’ activities in  
the medieval Broad Sanctuary. Diageo’s huge portfolio  
of alcoholic drinks includes Guinness and the lion’s  
share of all Scotch whisky companies. Expansion  
started when the Greenes moved from their roots in  
Broad Sanctuary to the other end of today’s Victoria  
Street where they established the Stag brewery near  
where Marks and Spencer is today and where until  
recently there was a Stag Place. A stag was the motto  
of the Green family.  
The brewery belonged to the Greene family until  
1787 and it didn’t do badly. In 1722 it was described  
as being “the finest Brewhouse in Europe”. Expansion  
gathered pace and in 1837 James Watney, a miller  
from Wandsworth, bought a quarter share and  
became a partner with another local brewer, John  
Lettsom Elliott. For a while the premises were known  
as Elliot Watney and Company (Fig 12). The entrance  
was at the end of today’s Castle Lane, which used to  
be called Cabbage Lane and had two alleys running  
off it, called Powder Beef Court and Mustard Alley.  
The site was opposite today’s Victoria Palace theatre,  
where a branch of Marks and Spencer currently takes  
up part of the space.  
By 1858 the brewery was under James Watney’s  
control until his death, aged well over 80, in 1884\.  
After his death, Watney & Co started a prolonged  
period of merger mania. The fusion of Watney with  
Combe and Co of Long Acre and then Reid’s stout of  
Clerkenwell into Watney, Combe & Reid was reckoned  
to have been the first big merger in the history of  
British brewing. In 1958 came an even bigger union  
when Watney merged with Mann, Crossman & Paulin  
to form Watney Mann. That wasn’t the end of it.  
In 1972, Grand Metropolitan, the huge hotel and  
hospitality group, acquired Watney Mann. Grand Met  
later merged these acquisitions with Truman Hanbury  
Buxton. An even bigger merger happened in 1997  
when Diageo was formed through the merger of the  
iconic Guinness plc \- which can trace its own ancestry  
back to 1759 \- with Grand Metropolitan plc, creating  
one of the world’s largest producers of alcoholic  
beverages. The merger combined Guinness’s brewing  
and spirits expertise with Grand Metropolitan’s  
extensive portfolio in food, beverages, and hospitality.  
Why is it called Diageo? The word combines the  
Latin word Dies (day) with the Greek geo (meaning  
work or earth). The Stag brewery lasted until 1959,  
well within the memory of some local residents, but  
was deemed too small for the enlarged company’s  
needs and was closed down.Watney had achieved  
considerable success with its alliterative slogan “What  
We Want is Watneys” but ran into trouble when the  
emerging Campaign for Real Ale went for it and other  
brewers in a big way, with sustained criticism of its  
huge promotion of the Red Barrel keg beer.  
In his book The Red Barrel: A history of Watney  
Mann, Hurford Janes observed: “In or near the  
Broad Sanctuary, the Greene family continued to  
brew beer and to prosper. The records of the Abbey  
show granting or renewal of countless properties  
in this area. The long vanished Green’s Alley, now  
dominated by such figures as Abraham Lincoln and  
Benjamin Disraeli, took its name from the tenure of  
what was once Abbey land”.  
Actual dates are rare, but as far back as 1420  
Fig 11\. Rocque’s map 1746 with Green’s Alley in yellow  
Thomas Greene, was elected Master of the Brewers’s  
Company Company, and so may have been brewing  
years before at Westminster which seems to have  
been the centre of his early operations. Most of the  
subsequent Green(e)s seem to have been called John  
or William. At one stage, John Green held the Nag’s  
Head, the Chequers, the Raven, the Windmill and the  
Buffalo’s Head in King Street while William is reported  
to have relinquished occupation of the Talbot (later the  
Three Tuns) next to the medieval Gatehouse in 1607  
after occupying it for 40 years.  
Fig 12\.  
24 25Nothing remains of the brewery building. An old  
photo (Fig 13\) shows the site of the Stag Tap pub in  
Castle Lane, which was used by brewery employees,  
and Westminster Archives has produced photographic  
records of what it was like to work there including  
YouTube videos. The buildings to the rear of the pub  
in the picture, including the Westminster Chapel, are  
still functioning.  
The only structure surviving from the earlier Greene  
era is the beautiful Wren-like Bluecoat (Blewcoat)  
school in Brewers Green, Caxton Street, which was  
built in 1709 by William Greene, partly to educate  
the children of employees, but also to keep barrels  
of beer in the basement. The name Brewers’ Green  
is almost certainly a pun on the connections of the  
Green(e) family to this historic place.  
Christopher Wren was associated with the school  
and may well have been the architect as it was in his  
style and according to Hurford Janes in his History  
of Watneys: “The architect had every reason to be  
grateful to a man who made it possible for his grand  
design for the Royal Hospital to attain fulfilment”. The

William Greene was also one of the founders of

Westminster Hospital. He joined other philanthropists

hospital for poorer people who at the time had no  
access to health care. The work of Sir Henry and his  
colleagues, explained elsewhere, helped to lay the

Yard (Fig 16\) was a tragedy from  
an archaeological point of view.

place apart to provide space  
for \- wait for it \- a five-storey  
underground park for 450 cars  
for MPs.  
The government of the day  
was dismissive of any possible  
archaeological finds.  
No digging was allowed,  
only a reluctant permission  
for archaeologists to keep “a  
watching brief”. Which they  
did, and what they found was  
remarkable in the circumstances:  
the huge octagonal base of a  
canopied fountain as seen in  
purple in front of the clock tower  
on Hollar’s engraving. It had been built by Henry Vl in  
1443 and contained marble slabs, the remains of an  
earlier 12th century conduit. The fountain lasted until  
the late 17th century. It is not known how high it was  
but judging from Hollar’s impression it was far higher  
than the local people who look tiny in comparison and  
looked nearly as tall as nearby houses.  
As the only secular fountain in the area not linked to a

church or monastery, it would have been used by local  
people as part of the everyday life of medieval London  
and, doubtless, a popular source of local gossip, the  
equivalent of today’s water cooler talk in the office.  
It supplied water to the royal palace as well as the  
ordinary folk of Westminster.  
Henry VI had granted permission to the parish to  
make use of the surplus water; in 1524 there is this  
The gatehouse, Clock Tower, the Conduit and Westminster Hall are in colour (Agas map 1560-1570)  
28 29it is so sad, not to say outrageous, that they weren’t  
preserved on the site itself. This didn’t happen because  
politicians were opposed to letting the archaeologists  
loose. What might they get up to? It is a puzzle why  
neither the Government nor archaeologists appear  
to have used the Hollar drawing \- which has proved  
pretty accurate in most respects \- as a reason to  
excavate more carefully in the area where the conduit  
was likely to be. The Government wanted a huge car  
park for MPs and that was that.  
The matter was discussed in the Commons by \- who  
else?- two old Etonians. On 29th November 1972,  
Paul Channon, Conservative Minister for Housing and  
Construction told Tam Dalyell (Labour, West Lothian)  
that delay would be “expensive and inconvenient” and  
could only be justified if there were “really important  
and closely defined archaeological objectives in view”.  
That was probably intended to exclude everything.  
However, although archaeologists managed to secure  
a “watching brief” they were unable to preserve this  
fascinating artefact in its original place. It is now being  
kept somewhere in storage, a memory of Thorney  
Island waiting to be restored. There are other parts  
of Edward the Confessor’s palace in Old Palace Yard  
which are believed to be lying underground in the  
vicinity of the statue of Richard the Lionheart. Let us  
hope that when the upcoming restoration of Parliament  
takes place, politicians will have a greater regard for  
the preservation of our heritage. 9: The history of Britain in one building  
Uncovering the Grand Conduit (MOLA)  
mention in the churchwardens’ accounts: “The King’s  
Charter for the Condett at the Pales’gate remayneth  
in the custody of the Churchwardens.” Occasionally,  
something more dramatic happened. According to the  
medieval historian, John Stow, on special occasions  
such as the coronation of Edward ll in 1307, it  
was “made to run with wine out of divers, spouts.”  
Apparently it was “a beautiful fountain, the water of  
which fell in large cascades.”  
Sometime between 1658 and 1660, just before the  
Restoration of the Monarchy, the Great Conduit in  
New Palace yard was demolished, but, fortunately, its  
memory \- and its location \- had been fixed by Hollar  
a few years earlier.  
We should be grateful that remains of the Great

of its kind in the world.  
30 31Thorney Island took its own revenge. When Henry lV  
was nearing the end of his life he decided to undergo  
a pilgrimage to Jerusalem to atone for his sins, not  
least his usurpation of the throne of Richard II He  
believed a prophecy in Holinshed’s Chronicles that he  
would “not die but in Jerusalem”. In 1413, on his way  
to the Holy Land, he stopped off at Westminster Abbey  
to pray at the tomb of St Edward the Confessor where  
he collapsed. He was taken to the nearby Jerusalem  
Chamber where he did indeed die, thereby fulfilling  
Holinshed’s prophecy in an unexpected manner.  
(Insert cross ref)  
Not even Holinshead could have prophesied what  
Westminster Abbey experienced thereafter. Dorian  
Gerhold, the historian, sums it up:  
“Nowhere else in the world is there a building which  
has been so closely involved in the life of a nation  
for such a long period. The history of the hall was  
therefore almost a history of England and of Great  
Britain”.  
But where to start and where to finish? The trial  
and execution of Charles 1, or that of Sir William  
“Braveheart” Wallace, or Sir Thomas More, or Guy  
Fawkes? Oliver Cromwell was not tried there, but after  
the Restoration of the Monarchy in May, 1660, his  
body was exhumed and his head affixed to a pole on  
one of the towers of the hall where it stayed for over  
25 years as a warning to anyone thinking of deposing  
a king. It was then passed through private collections  
before being buried in 1960 at a secret location at his  
former college Sidney Sussex in Cambridge.  
This left Charles l, who was buried at Windsor Castle,  
a long way from the man who had him executed.  
Except that Thorney Island had other ideas. Cromwell  
has a statue outside Westminster hall. If you look  
immediately across the road on the eastern wall of St  
Margaret’s Church there is a small lead bust of none  
Charles l looking at Cromwell from the wall of St Margaret’s Church  
other than Charles l attached to the wall glaring at his  
executioner.  
Charles I is buried in St George’s Chapel at Windsor  
Castle. After his execution on 30th January 1649,  
his body was interred there on 9th February 1649,  
following a decision by Parliament to deny him burial  
in Westminster Abbey to prevent public unrest. His  
remains were placed in the same burial vault as Henry  
VIII and Jane Seymour.  
The impeachment of Warren Hastings, the first  
Governor of Bengal, at Westminster Hall in 1787  
for corruption, was described in the King’s Works as  
“one of the most extraordinary legal proceedings on  
record”. It adds: “20 volumes of parliamentary reports,  
11 folio volumes of evidence, 3,000 pages of oratory,  
20 years of agitation, memorable performances by  
Burke, Fox and Sheridan all resulting in an acquittal  
seven years after the start of the trial”. Protector  
Somerset, Lord Protector of England from 1547 to  
1549 during the minority of Edward Vl, was not so  
lucky. He was acquitted of treason but executed for a  
felony.  
These incidents happened during an astonishing period  
of almost 700 years when Westminster Hall, besides  
having nearly 50 shops, also housed all the main  
courts and played a pivotal role in the development of  
the English legal system. This included the rule of law  
and trial by jury which in turn influenced legal systems  
around the world, especially in the colonies including  
the American Constitution and Bill of Rights.  
One person who was not granted trial by jury was  
Charles l, who in 1649 was tried by a special court in  
Westminster Hall but not allowed to say a word in his  
defence. English justice took a brief holiday.  
The law courts stayed in Westminster Hall until after  
the Great Fire of 1834 which devastated the Houses  
of Parliament but left Westminster Hall intact thanks  
to favourable winds and special instructions to  
fire fighters to preserve the historic hall at all costs.  
However, it was realised soon after that overcrowding  
had become a serious problem and it was decided to  
move the Courts of Law and Equity, Divorce, Probate  
and Bankruptcy into one location in the Strand. Some  
700 years of tradition moved on.  
Of all the amazing things that happened in Westminster  
Hall, one tiny thing keeps coming back to me. In 1904  
some of the oak beams needed replacing. Offers from  
Australia and Ireland were turned down as English  
oak was preferred. Things looked grim until George  
Courthope whose, Wadhurst family estate \- can you  
believe it \- had supplied many of the oak trees 600  
years earlier, offered replacements. Later on, during a  
debate on the Forestry Commission Courthope, now  
Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster Hall  
an MP, revealed that the replacement beams had over  
600 annual rings. In other words they were already  
growing when the original trees were felled. If you  
know of a better example of longtermism it would be  
good to know.

1731, he was made a director of the Royal African  
Company, England’s biggest slave trading operation,  
but he appears to have had a change of heart when  
he purchased the freedom of an enslaved African  
trader called Ayuba Suleiman Diallo after seeing a  
letter written by him. Oglethorpe seems to have lost  
interest in Diallo after that, but the experience led him  
to resign from the Royal African Company and after  
arriving in Georgia he instituted a ban on slavery. He also banned alcohol (which would not have been  
popular in Old Palace Yard). He hoped to settle what  
were called England’s “worthy poor” in Georgia  
starting with those in prison for debts.  
Oglethorpe’s action in banning slavery when Georgia  
was founded in 1733 was well before more celebrated  
abolitionists such as Wilberforce. However, the  
prohibition seems to have been largely ignored after  
Oglethorpe left Georgia in 1743\. A huge opportunity  
for Britain to have taken an earlier lead in abolishing  
slavery was lost.

at Runnymede in 1215, but which  
had been ill-observed since then.

36 37A key stage in the growth of a modern Parliament  
is often thought to be 1258 in Oxford when nobles  
led by Simon De Montfort (who had been born and  
bred in France) drafted the Provisions of Oxford This  
stripped Henry lll of his unrestrained authority and  
placed him under the guidance of 24 people (all men)  
of whom half were nominated by the King and half  
by the “reformers”, mainly De Montfort’s supporters.  
The document called for regular Parliaments with  
representatives from the counties. This was an important  
development in the evolution of Parliament, but as it  
mainly consisted of nobles, De Montfort’s allies, and  
gentry, it is not regarded as a lasting precursor of  
today’s populist Parliament.  
In 1264, De Montfort roundly defeated his former  
friend, King Henry lll, at the Battle of Lewes and  
afterwards seized power. For a year he was the  
unelected ruler of Britain, having gained power by  
imprisoning his own King. He summoned a parliament  
on January 20, 1265, most likely in the Chapter  
House. For the first time not only were churchmen,  
barons, and two knights from each shire summoned,  
but also two commoners from each of the boroughs.  
Technically, this was a milestone as it was the first  
needed money for his wars in Scotland and France. It  
has been regarded as a model for the future because  
it contained not only the higher ranks of clergy and  
gentry, but also the “lower orders” of clergy plus two  
citizens from each city and two burgesses from each  
borough. However, most of these constituents were not  
exactly representative of the people at large and can  
be traced to earlier parliaments.  
More importantly, the “Commons” on this occasion  
met separately from the upper ranks which proved a  
template for the emergence of a true democracy. It  
wasn’t truly representative of the people as there was  
no widespread suffrage and its “model” excluded half  
of the population: Women.  
In April 1343, another staging post was reached. It  
was the first time when the meeting place of the lower  
house or Commons was actually recorded. It was  
when Edward lll opened parliament in the wonderfully  
ornate Painted Chamber with its warlike scenes from  
the bible (tapestry above) after which he and the top  
brass withdrew, leaving the Commons alone until they  
had finished their business. It has been estimated that  
41 meetings of Parliament were held there between  
1399 and 1484\.  
The Good Parliament of 1376, also held in the Painted  
Chamber, is linked to the Peasants’ Revolt of 1381,  
through its exposure of governmental corruption and  
the subsequent failure to implement lasting reforms.  
The parliament’s efforts to address corruption  
were reversed by John of Gaunt, leading to public  
dissatisfaction. This disillusionment, combined with  
economic hardships and oppressive imposts such as  
the Poll Tax, fueled the grievances that erupted in the  
Peasants’ Revolt, during which John of Gaunt’s London  
home, the Savoy Palace, was looted and burned. It  
is remembered today by the Savoy Hotel which is on  
part of the same site.  
Sadly, the Painted Chamber has long been demolished  
though, according to historian David Harrison, the  
remains could still survive under Old Palace Yard east  
of the statue of Richard the Lionheart. He also believes  
that the remains of the Lesser Hall or White Hall, used  
for meetings of the House of Lords, could be under the  
north side of the same statue awaiting discovery by  
archaeologists.

religious use, St Stephen’s Chapel, courtesy of the  
Protestant Edward lV, became the first permanent  
home of the Commons. The new building retained  
the earlier layout with lines of monks facing each  
other on benches, a fact that is often blamed for the  
confrontational way the main parties do business with  
each other today.  
However, judging by contemporary accounts, the  
behaviour of the Commons while sitting was far worse  
even than it is today, not helped by the fact that bills

like Damon Runyon’s floating crap game in Guys and  
of one long wall are preserved in the garden of  
Dolls. They had to find rooms that happened to be  
available.  
The monks’ refectory at Westminster Abbey had been  
used by Parliament for short periods in the late 13th  
century, but in 1397 the House of Commons moved  
there and used it as its regular base after vacating the  
Chapter House. This marked the permanent return of  
the Chapter House to the monks.  
The monks were pleased to have their Chapter  
House back, but the much bigger refectory did not  
lead to harmonious relations. Apart from the general  
rowdiness of the MPs, the monks had to cope not only  
with vacating the hall when MPs needed it, but also to  
the consequences of up to 300 MPs needing to wash  
their hands and use the latrines. The sharing of the hall  
was not a marriage made in Heaven. It was mainly  
used when Westminster Hall or other parts of the  
Ashburnham House, now part of  
Westminster School. Part of it can be  
seen from a window in the upstairs  
section of the Abbey’s Cellarium Café  
which is open to the public.  
The new permanent home lasted for  
nearly 300 years until the great fire of  
1834 which destroyed nearly all of the  
old palace including St Stephen’s Chapel  
(but the crypt of St Mary Undercroft  
immediately underneath escaped serious  
damage). The Chapel was reconstructed  
in the same style as before by Charles  
Barry, the architect of the new Parliament  
building. The revamped building, called  
St Stephen’s Hall, is now the entrance  
for public visits to Parliament For much  
of its life, the Chapel, which dates back  
to 1365, together with the associated St  
Stephen’s College, were at the centre of  
not just religion but political life as well.  
This was because the canons who lived  
there were diplomats and administrators  
as well as ministers of religion. MPs  
weren’t the only ones involved with  
politics.  
It is clear that individual countries are  
adept at interpreting their parliamentary  
history in a nationalistic way and  
England is no exception, but the claim  
that England is the mother of parliaments  
is difficult to refute. Mothers have children  
and as a result of Britain’s history of  
colonialism, the legacy of the English  
Parliament is evident in the way medieval  
common law has influenced the legal  
systems of Canada, Australia, India and

The stunning chapel of St Mary Undercroft and the  
equally stunning cloisters surrounding it (below) are  
all that remain of the medieval Palace of Westminster,  
apart from the Jewel Tower on the opposite side of  
Old Palace Yard. Sadly, only the Jewel Tower is open  
to the public today as the cloisters are used by MPs for  
parliamentary business and the undercroft is deemed  
too small to accommodate regular visitors. Originally,  
they were all part of St Stephen’s Chapel and its  
associated institution, St Stephen’s College.  
St Mary’s is the undercroft of St Stephen’s Chapel,  
described by the parliamentary website as “the  
forgotten heart of the Palace of Westminster”. They  
should know. For centuries after it was finally finished  
in 1365, the Chapel, together with St Stephen’s  
College, were at the centre not just of religion but of  
political life as well. This was because the canons who  
lived there were diplomats and administrators, as well  
as ministers of religion. After the Reformation around  
1548, the newly secularised building was handed over  
one of the great building projects of  
the Middle Ages, but because of the  
stop/start nature of its construction  
it took over 70 years before it was  
finally completed in 1365\. (In case  
of interest, the 1851 Crystal Palace,  
the largest building in the world at  
the time, constructed of cast iron and  
glass, took a mere nine months to  
build).

The unsavory conditions of the  
cloisters led the former Labour  
Home Secretary Jack Straw to  
describe the area as a Gothic  
slum. Apart from the Jewel Tower  
and Westminster Hall (the latter  
not part of the old royal palace)  
the cloisters and the undercroft  
are the only surviving remnants of  
the old Palace which lasted from  
the 11th century until Henry Vlll  
moved the whole shebang up the  
road to Whitehall after the fire of  
1512\.  
It is reckoned that 80% of the undercroft is more or  
less original and the rest modernised.  
There has been a lot of research in recent years into  
St Stephen’s College, a collegiate institution linked to  
the Chapel (built 50 years later) including a virtual  
reproduction of it which can be seen at  
https://www.virtualststephens.org.uk/explore  
For seven centuries, St Stephen’s was at the centre of  
the political and religious life of the nation. The height  
of its political influence was during its long association  
with the upwardly mobile Cardinal Wolsey. Wolsey  
was more associated with St Stephen’s College than  
St Stephen’s Chapel. He served as the dean of St  
Stephen’s College from 1512 to 1514, during which  
time he played a role in its development, including the  
construction of the cloisters. His coat of arms can be  
seen as a “boss” in the ceiling of the east walk of the  
cloister.  
Not yet open to the public \- Cloister Court (Parliament / Estates Archive)  
According to historian Elizabeth Biggs, Wolsey used  
the opportunity to reward his faithful priests and  
retinue whilst also placing his own followers in the  
royal administration. In 1511, Wolsey’s unofficial  
brother-in-law Thomas Larke was made a cannon.  
Larke’s sister Joan was Wolsey’s mistress and the  
mother of his son Thomas Winter who also appears  
as a cannon until 1529, when he was pushed out  
after his father’s downfall when Wolsey failed to get  
an annulment of Henry VIII’s marriage to Catherine of  
Aragon. John Veysey, Richard Samson and Thomas  
Thirlby (remembered today by Thirlby Road off Victoria  
Street) also owed their advancement to Wolsey.  
After the Reformation, St Stephen’s was handed over  
to the emerging House of Commons as their first  
permanent home where MPs sat until the Great Fire  
of 1834 when it was redesigned by Charles Barry as  
St Stephen’s Hall. It is now the public entrance into  
Parliament.  
13: King Cnut \- did he or didn’t he?  
Canute giving his courtiers a physics lesson (1848 R E Pine public domain)  
King Canute \- or Cnut \- is best known as the monarch  
who may, or may not, have tried to hold back the  
oncoming waves on a beach somewhere or other.  
Less well known is that he was the most successful of  
four Danish kings who ruled England and was the first  
king to build a palace on Thorney Island. Part of the  
evidence for this is that his son Harold Harefoot \- who  
was regent of England from 1035 to 1037 and King  
of the English from 1037 to 1040 \- was buried in the  
Abbey, albeit briefly, which makes it likely that Cnut  
had been living in a palace there.  
Not many people strolling from Parliament Square  
towards Millbank realise that they are likely walking  
over the remains of the palace of Canute.

For the next 500 years, Thorney Island was the royal

When the English King Æthelred died in 1016, his  
Monarchs didn’t usually spend much time at their  
son Edmund Ironside led the defence against Cnut’s  
London abodes as they had so many other mansions

England leading to a final one in Essex, probably at  
as England wasn’t the only country he was monarch  
Ashingdon, where Cnut’s Danes were victorious with

many killed on the English side. The Anglo-Saxon  
King of Denmark from 1018, and King of Norway

peace, dividing the kingdom between them. Edmund

ruler. He brought stability to a country that had been  
suffering from perpetual raids by Vikings from across  
the North Sea. He turned the country into an integrated  
state which made it easier to collect taxes to fund any  
wars. This was such a successful formula that Cnut  
applied it to his native Denmark and other countries  
under his rule.  
Success in war appeared to make Cnut a more gentle  
and religious character, at least when had seen off  
or executed rival nobles. It was maybe part of this  
newfound gentility that persuaded Cnut \- if of course  
the story is true \- to assemble his courtiers to see  
whether he could stem the waves. The main source for  
this story was Henry of Huntingdon who in the 12th  
century quoted it as an example of Cnut’s “graceful  
and magnificent behaviour”.  
According to Huntingdon, Canute set his throne by  
the sea shore and “commanded the incoming tide to  
halt and not wet his feet and robes”. Yet “continuing  
to rise as usual (the tide) dashed over his feet and  
legs without respect to his royal person”. Then the  
King leapt backwards, saying: “Let all men know how  
empty and worthless is the power of kings, for there  
is none worthy of the name, but He whom heaven,  
earth, and sea obey by eternal laws.” He then hung  
his gold crown on a crucifix, and never wore it again.  
Cnut’s purpose was not, as many in the past have  
believed, to command the waves to go back but  
to prove that he was a mere mortal and could not  
do such a thing. Only God could do that. This can  
be interpreted as displaying Cnut’s modesty or,  
alternatively, his pride as he may be hinting that as  
a King his powers were second only to that of God.  
The site of the episode is often identified as Thorney  
Island (Westminster), where Canute set up a royal  
palace. There is, however, another Thorney Island,  
a small peninsula within Chichester harbour with a  
rival claim and, confusingly, a sign on Canute Road  
in Southampton’s city centre which reads, “Near  
Cnut enthronedthis spot, AD 1028 Canute reproved his courtiers”.  
Bosham in West Sussex also claims to be the site of  
this episode, as does Gainsborough in Lincolnshire.  
As Gainsborough is inland, if the story is true, then  
Canute would have been trying to turn back the  
tidal bore known as the Aegir, a name borrowed  
from Norse mythology. Another tradition places this  
episode on the north coast of the Wirral, which at  
the time was part of Mercia. The fact that Huntingdon  
mentions that the incident happened by the sea shore  
may rule out Westminster in some eyes, but in those  
days the Thames was both tidal and much wider than  
it is today. Who knows? Maybe it was just an early  
example of fake news proving that fiction is so often  
more powerful than fact.

46 4714: Drama above the bookshop  
The Abbey bookshop beneath the Jerusalem Chamber and ancient hall  
Not many people going into the Abbey bookshop  
bother to look at the stone wall above. It is no ordinary  
stone wall. Built in the 14th century mainly of Kentish  
ragstone, it is actually part of two buildings dripping  
with history either side of the narrow vertical column  
which divides the top of the Jerusalem Chamber on the  
left from the longer College Hall on the right. They are  
part of the Abbot’s dwelling known as Cheyneygates  
(from the French chene meaning oak). It is probably  
the longest continuously occupied home in London, if  
not in the rest of the country as well. It was here that  
the future King Edward V, later one of the Princes in the  
Tower, was born to the Queen, Elizabeth Woodville,  
when she claimed sanctuary in 1470 when Edward lV  
a second time, seeking sanctuary  
after the death of Edward lV and  
was persuaded to let her younger  
son Richard join his brother in the  
Tower of London.  
The longer wall on the right is the  
top of one side of College Hall,  
currently used as a dining hall for  
King’s Scholars of Westminster  
School, but in medieval times was  
where Elizabeth l used to come  
to witness pupils performing their  
traditional play in Latin and is  
also where Elizabeth Woodville  
spent much of her second stay in  
sanctuary. It is said to be one of  
the finest examples of a medieval  
refectory and its long tables made  
of chestnut wood were supposedly  
made from a wrecked vessel  
captured during the Spanish Armada.  
Next door is one end of the historic Jerusalem Chamber.  
The most dramatic event that took place there was the  
death of Henry lV, but the most influential was the  
signing off of the King James Bible. You don’t have to  
be a believer to appreciate the wonder of this event.  
The Jerusalem Chamber was one of three places \-  
Oxford, Cambridge and Westminster \- where the King  
James (KJ) Bible was compiled, and it was the actual  
room in which it was eventually signed off in 1611\.  
This was a book written by committees, surely, you  
might think, a certain recipe for failure. Yet it turned  
out to be one of the most influential \- and beautifully  
written \- books ever produced, having sold over 5  
was exiled abroad. It was where she moved in 1483  
billion copies worldwide in its  
various versions. The Harry Potter  
series has notched up a mere 500  
million copies (though still one of  
the all-time best selling books).  
Melvin Bragg, the author and  
presenter, in his book The Adventure  
of English, says it became “the most  
influential book that there has ever  
been in the history of language,  
English, or any other”. No book  
has sold more copies than the King  
James Bible all over the world.  
Actuallly, the KJ Bible was  
very heavily based on William  
Tyndale’s earlier bible which had  
been banned among other things  
because \- horror of horrors \- it  
was written in English not Latin so  
interpretation would no longer be  
the preserve of monks and priests, but available to  
ordinary people to make their own minds up.  
Tyndale translated key parts of the Bible from Greek  
and Hebrew into English to fulfill his ambition to make  
the Bible accessible to ordinary people so that even  
a “boy who driveth the plow” would be able to read  
the Scriptures.  
In 1530 Sir Thomas Moore, author of the idealised  
world, Utopia, disagreed. He had complained about  
the disgrace of the Bible being in English “in the  
language of ploughboys”. Despite this, the KJ Bible  
sold 5bn copies to ploughboys and all.  
But whose bible was it? An astonishing amount of  
Tyndale’s earlier version was retained in the KJ Bible.  
A paper by Jon Nielson and Royal Akousen claims  
that “for the New Testament, Tyndale’s contribution  
is about 84 per cent of the text, while in the Old  
The Jerusalem Chamber today  
Testament about 76 per cent of his words have been  
retained”. This is not just plagiarism, but plagiarism  
on an industrial scale.  
And what happened to William Tyndale? Did he get  
any royalties? No, he was at the time on the wrong  
side of the Reformation. He was convicted of heresy in  
1536 and executed by strangulation before his body  
was burnt at the stake in Brabant near Brussels. But  
they didn’t kill his reputation. In 2002, Tyndale came  
26th in the BBC’s poll of the 100 greatest Britons.48 4915: The unique story of Poets’ Corner  
A unique treasure of Westminster Abbey is Poets’  
Corner, where Britain’s literary greatness is sanctified.  
I still feel a mild buzz whenever I visit it, but I sometimes  
wonder how many people in this country have actually  
heard about the space let alone know the three poets  
whose burial in the Abbey gave rise to it.  
There are two ways of looking at Poets’ Corner: one  
is what is there and the other is what is not there.  
What is not there, let’s face it, is any representation of  
half of the population. For well over 400 years not a  
single female poet or playwright has been buried in  
this hallowed spot (though there are a few memorials  
such as to Fanny Burney), a sobering reminder of the  
historic dominance of the male, not least ecclesiastical,  
over our culture.  
It took three men to establish it as a “corner” for  
poets. Geoffrey Chaucer, author of the Canterbury  
Tales, was the first to be buried in the south transept  
of the Abbey in 1400\. However, this was not because  
of his poetic genius but because of his day job \- he  
was Clerk of the King’s Works. He was later moved  
to his present position in 1556 over 150 years later,  
probably because Queen “Bloody” Mary (who  
reigned from 1553 to 1558\) wanted to restore a bit of  
Catholicism to the Abbey after the rigid Protestantism  
of her predecessor Edward Vl, the son of Henry Vlll.  
Chaucer is still one of Britain’s greatest writers.  
His “Canterbury Tales” hasn’t been out of print for  
approaching 600 years though if you are in Poets’  
Corner today it is noticeable that practically all the  
visitors have their backs to his  
ancient grave with eyes only  
for the numerous memorial  
and through the trembling air  
sweet breathing Zephyrus did  
softly play,” etc.)  
What we didn’t learn at  
school was that this wonderful  
lyrical poet \- writer of lines  
like “Sweet Thames run softly  
till I end my song” \- also had  
a day job. He had been  
Secretary to Lord Grey, Lord  
Deputy of Ireland, where he  
favoured a scorched earth  
policy to defeat the rebels  
who eventually succeeded  
in expelling him from his  
dwelling and plundered his  
goods. He returned to England  
a poor man. He died shortly  
afterwards and was buried  
near his hero Chaucer.  
The third of the early occupants How not to look at Chaucer’s grave  
slabs on the floor in front with  
more familiar names such as  
Tennyson, Henry James, T S Eliot  
and Robert Browning.  
However, one poetic burial  
doesn’t make a grouping.  
Edmund Spenser, author of  
The Faerie Queene, dedicated  
to Elizabeth l, was the second  
person to be buried in what was  
at the time a little used space in  
the Abbey. Some of his poems  
such as Prothalamion were so  
rammed into me at grammar  
school \- with punishment if you  
forgot \- that I can still remember  
of Poets’ Corner was Michael Drayton, whose  
profile could easily have been mistaken for that of  
Shakespeare: born and bred in Warwickshire, went  
to London, a prolific poet, author or part-author of  
over 20 plays and part owner of a playhouse. Of the  
portraits of Drayton and Shakespeare that normally  
hang in the National Portrait Gallery, it is Drayton  
who is wearing the laurels. Few major poets have  
been forgotten so quickly.  
What is regarded as Drayton’s magnum opus, Poly-  
Olbion, is one of the most extraordinary poems in the  
English language. That is partly because of its length  
(15,000 lines in iambic pentameter), partly because  
of how long it took to write (30 years), and partly  
because of the subject matter. It is a topographical  
epic about the history of England and Wales, which  
E M Forster called an “incomparable poem”. It may  
be about to get a reappraisal. Exeter University has  
been involved in a major study of Poly-Olbion, not  
yet published at the time of writing.  
On 23rd December 1631, Drayton died at his  
Fleet Street home almost penniless, his form of  
pastoral poetry having gone out of fashion. Yet  
he was so highly regarded by his contemporaries  
that, according to the antiquary William Fulman:  
“The Gentlemen of the Four Innes of Court and  
others of note about the Town, attended his body to  
Westminster.”  
Drayton is perhaps best known today by the claim  
that it was after a heavy drinking session in a  
Poets’ Corner without visitors. Left to right Chaucer, Drayton, Spenserthem today (“Calm was the day  
50 51Stratford-upon-Avon tavern in 1616 with Ben Jonson  
and Shakespeare that the latter contracted an illness  
and died. Experts have tended to disbelieve this tale  
as it was based on a claim by a local clergyman over  
30 years after Shakespeare’s death. I used to find that  
disbelief credible, but now that I’m at an age when I  
can more easily remember what happened 40 years  
previously that a few minutes ago I am not so sure.  
It is a sobering fact that at least two of the three founding  
writers in Poets’ Corner \- Drayton and Spenser \- died  
in poverty only to be given what seemed like State  
funerals on their deaths. It is also possible, but not yet  
proven, that Chaucer, burdened by unpaid debts, also  
died in poverty. Even more sobering is the likelihood  
that nearly all of the visitors to the Abbey and Poets’  
Corner \- mainly from abroad \- have never heard  
of Drayton or Spenser and many of them probably  
haven’t heard of Chaucer either despite the fact that  
The Canterbury Tales hasn’t been out of print for well  
over 500 years. The times they are a’ changing. This  
does nothing to alter the fact that there always seems  
to be a bit of magic in the air as visitors become  
imbued at least temporarily in the thrall of poesy in the  
much expanded Poets’ Corner.  
Thomas A Prendergast in his scholarly history of  
Poets’ Corner, Poetical Dust, says that it was only  
after Lady Anne Clifford, Countess of Dorset, erected  
monuments to both Edmund Spenser in 1620 and to  
Michael Drayton in1631, that Poets’ Corner became  
somewhere special. This, he suggests, makes her “the  
godmother of the modern notion of Poets Corner”.  
What Anne Clifford would have made of the fact that  
nearly 400 years after she helped to establish it there  
are still no women buried at Poets’ Corner, can only  
be guessed at.  
Once you become aware of the absence of women  
at Poets’ Corner it conjures up their presence in an  
Shakespeare and Michael Drayton (left, wearing the laurel crown) in the  
National Portrait Gallery.  
ethereal way, a kind of virtual monument, defined  
by their absence. This also applies to one man who  
isn’t buried there, William Shakespeare. He has a  
memorial but his body remains buried in his local  
church Holy Trinity in Stratford-upon-Avon, despite  
various unsuccessful attempts to move it to Westminster.  
It clearly takes something away from the grandeur of  
Poets’ Corner that there are no women buried there  
and our only poet/playwright with global recognition,  
Shakespeare, is buried elsewhere, but it doesn’t seem  
to worry the huge number of visitors, well over 90%  
from abroad, who pass through it each day.

Countess of Dorset, who was instrumental in the early52 53Aphra was a star of Restoration drama during the  
reign of Charles ll. She wrote poetry and 18 successful  
plays which was more than any male dramatist at the  
time, with the possible exception of John Dryden. She  
was held in esteem by her peers but not long after  
sank almost without trace for centuries. This was partly  
because Restoration drama fell out of fashion and  
partly because she wrote in a bawdy fashion which  
was tolerated for men \- such as the Earl of Rochester  
\- but later not thought a fit occupation for a woman.  
In recent years she has made a comeback partly due  
to Virginia Woolf’s famous exhortation on her tomb,  
that “all women together ought to let flowers fall”.  
Which is what happened in the Summer of 2021,  
when pupils from Urswick School in Hackney laid  
flowers on her grave with personal messages after  
they had given a performance of some of Aphra’s  
work in the hallowed atmosphere of nearby Poets’  
Corner. I was delighted to be part of the audience

establishment of the corner as a special place. Both  
the second and third occupants of the space, Edmund  
Spenser and Michael Drayton (who is hardly known at  
all these days), were sponsored by the Countess. She  
was also a friend of Amelia Lanier, now recognised  
as a proto-feminist and the first woman in England to  
have published a collection of her own poetry. She  
even dared to think that maybe Adam tempted Eve in  
the Garden of Eden and not the other way around.  
Some people think Amelia was the Dark Lady of  
Shakespeare’s sonnets. Others that she actually wrote  
the works of Shakespeare, but let that pass. She lived  
for a key part of her life a stone’s throw away from  
Poets’ Corner in Longditch (today’s Storey’s Gate).  
She would certainly have been a candidate for Poets’  
Corner in an open contest.  
One woman who nearly made it, at least geographically,  
was Aphra Behn, poet and playwright, who is buried  
literally a few yards away in the East Cloister of the  
Abbey. Only a stone wall \- and a glass ceiling \- have  
kept her out.  
along with others from London Historians. Aphra was  
from a humble background, but became an icon and  
role model. She is still a talking point among feminists,  
partly because she dealt with gender mixing themes  
and was a proud libertine at a time when it was  
fashionable among men. She didn’t seem to believe  
in a God, yet she dedicated part of a play to the  
staunchly Catholic James II before he did a moonlight  
flit out of the country.  
Aphra was probably the first woman to earn her living  
from writing, even though she was always short of  
money. Nell Gwynn appeared in one of her plays as  
did Anne Bracegirdle, an esteemed actress of the time  
(in The Widow Ranter in 1689). Anne is buried next  
to Aphra in the East Cloister.  
Also qualified for Poets’ Corner was the astonishing  
Margaret Cavendish (details chapter 41\) to whom  
history until recently has been wantonly unkind. The  
Duchess was a prolific author. She produced ten  
volumes of what have been described as “learned  
nowadays pored over for signs of deep insights. Her  
observations about natural science are today highly  
thought of. Her book, The Blazing World, is thought to  
be the first work of science fiction by a woman and a  
pioneer of the genre itself.  
Lucy Hutchinson (1620–1681) was a poet and  
translator who emerged from almost total anonymity in  
her own time to being considered a formidable author  
in her own right and a pioneering writer in English  
literary history. She was the first person to translate  
the text of Lucretius’s De Rerum Natura (On the Nature  
of Things) into heroic couplets and for writing Order  
and Disorder, also in heroic couplets. Often seen  
as a parallel version of Milton’s Paradise Lost from a  
female perspective, it has some claim to be the first  
epic poem written by an English woman. Germaine  
Greer acknowledges Hutchinson as “a serious writer  
who dared to undertake ambitious works on the  
largest scale” and calls her “a hero.”  
Another woman of literary note in the 17th century  
was Katherine (or Catherine) Philips (1632-1664)  
who was an Anglo-Welsh poet, playwright, a woman  
of letters and the translator of Pompey by the French  
playwright Pierre Corneille. Editions of her poetry  
published after her death were well received and she  
was highly regarded by later writers, including John  
Dryden and Keats.  
These are but a few examples of women poets in the  
17th century whose achievements are all the more  
impressive because they had to overcome not only the  
bias against women writers, but often also the time-  
consuming demands of married life. It is now unlikely  
that any women poets will be buried in the traditional  
way in the Abbey as pressure of space means almost  
all burials these days \- such as those of Stephen  
Hawking \- are of cremated remains.trifles and fantastic verses”. Cavendish was an early  
feminist whose poems, plays and literary critiques are

he helped Williams to go to Cambridge. There is no  
concrete evidence of this, but it could be that the record  
was either lost or erased. Williams must have got his  
considerable scientific knowledge from somewhere.  
Such success would have been highly unusual for  
anyone from a penniless white background at a time of  
widespread illiteracy. For it to happen to uneducated  
black people who emerged from a background of  
slavery and didn’t speak the language when they  
arrived, is genuinely amazing. There are still lessons  
to be learned today.  
They lived in a variety of places in London, but all  
Thorney Island has special links with several  
extraordinary 18th century writers of African descent  
who escaped from a background of slavery to become  
best-selling authors and leading abolitionists. While  
they were campaigning, Britain was still heavily  
engaged in the international slave trade and also  
fighting America and its allies, France and Spain, in  
the American War of Independence.  
The pioneers were Ignatius Sancho (1729-1780)  
who lived for a while on Thorney Island, and  
Ottobah Cugoano (1757-1791) who lived close by,  
overlooking St James’s Park. There is also a fourth,  
Francis Williams, whose extraordinary success has  
only recently emerged and is still being investigated.  
At the time of writing it was not known where he  
spent most of his time in London, though he may have  
lodged nearby. What is known is that the Duke of  
Montagu who mentored Sancho had a London home  
in the Thames near Thorney Island and it is claimed  
three had special ties with this part of Westminster. St  
Margaret’s Church, which is so close to Westminster  
Abbey that from a short distance it looks part of it, was  
where Equiano was baptised and Sancho married.  
Sancho’s children were baptised there. He himself  
is buried with his family in Christchurch Gardens in  
Palmer Street near the Albert pub which was then part  
of the burial ground of St Margaret’s.  
Black history also has another little known link with  
politician who lived in Old Palace Yard close to  
Westminster Hall, founded the colony of Georgia  
in 1731 where he introduced a ban on slavery.  
It faded after his departure from Georgia, but it  
remains an initiative long in advance of the success  
of English abolitionists towards the end of the century  
led by people like William Wilberforce (who lived  
in Old Palace Yard on the other side of the road to  
Oglethorpe).  
It is a curious fact that Sancho, Equiano and Cugoano  
(who worked in the studio of Richard Crosway  
overlooking St James’s Park) adopted the religion  
of their oppressors, but then used it to bang them to  
rights. In the preface to his book Cugoano explains  
why when he quotes the bible stating “he that stealeth  
a man and selleth him… then that thief shall die.”  
Equiano recalls in his book how shortly after his arrival  
in London following a trip abroad with his slave  
master, Captain Pascal, he was sent to wait upon two  
sisters called the Miss Guerins in Greenwich. They  
had treated him with great kindness when he was  
there before and sent him to school.  
and his wife Anne; Olaudau Equiano (1745-1797)  
Thorney Island. James Edward Oglethorpe, a Tory  
56 57He recalled that “while attending these ladies, their  
servants told me I could not go to Heaven unless I  
was baptised. This made me very uneasy; for I had  
now some faint idea of a future state: accordingly I  
communicated my anxiety to the eldest Miss Guerin,  
with whom I had become a favourite, and pressed her  
to have me baptised; when to my great joy she told  
me I should. I was baptised in St. Margaret’s church,  
Westminster, in February 1759”.  
He added: “I used to attend these ladies about the  
town, in which service I was extremely happy; as I  
had thus many opportunities of seeing London, which  
I desired of all things. I was sometimes, however,  
with my master at his rendezvous-house, at the foot  
of Westminster-bridge. Here I used to enjoy myself  
by playing about the bridge stairs, and often in the  
watermen’s wherries, with other boys.  
On one of these occasions there was another boy with  
me in a wherry, and we went out into the current of the  
river: while we were there two more stout boys came  
to us in another wherry, and, abusing us for taking  
the boat, desired me to get into the other wherry-boat.  
Accordingly I went to get out of the wherry I was in;  
but just as I had got one of my feet into the other boat  
the boys shoved it off, so that I fell into the Thames;  
and, not being able to swim, I should unavoidably  
have been drowned, but for the assistance of some  
watermen who providentially came to my relief.” If  
it had not been for such providence with the waters  
lapping Thorney Island, a man who later became one  
of the leading protagonists of abolition would have  
been denied to us.  
Charles Ignatius Sancho, to give him his full name,  
lived for a time in Canon Row before moving across  
today’s Whitehall to nearby (King) Charles Street. He  
was employed by the aristocratic Montagu family led  
by the Duke of Montagu, and his successor George  
Brudenell who became Duke Montagu of the second  
creation. The Montagus had numerous homes spread  
around England and Scotland including Greenwich  
and Richmond, but their main London abode was a  
Thames-side mansion in the Privy Garden a short stroll  
from Canon Row and (King) Charles Street. When a  
worsening outbreak of gout made it impossible for  
Sancho to work as a butler, Mary, the Duchess of  
Montagu, helped to set him up with a grocery shop  
in (King) Charles Street where the Foreign Office is  
today. She left him seventy pounds in her will, and an  
annuity of thirty pounds.  
Ownership of the shop gave Sancho a property  
qualification to vote. He was one of the first known  
black people in Britain to vote in an election. He cast  
his vote for Charles James Fox, a fellow abolitionist  
with whom he was friendly.  
Ignatius Sancho by Gainsborough  
An advert for tobacco sold by Sancho in his shop.  
Sancho, who was successful as a writer, composer  
and celebrity, was feted by Dr Johnson, painted by  
Gainsborough, and was a correspondent of Laurence  
Sterne (author of the hugely influential novel, The Life  
and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman) whom  
he actively encouraged to campaign against slavery.  
Sancho’s shop which, ironically, sold some of the  
products of slavery such as tobacco and sugar (there  
wasn’t much in the way of alternatives, such was the  
reach of slavery) was something of a social hub with  
painters, sculptors and politicians dropping by for a  
chat as well as a few purchases.  
Sancho’s stay on Thorney Island was dramatically  
reconstructed in October, 2023 (photo above) when  
the celebrated black actor Paterson Joseph, dressed  
in a similar garb to what Sancho was wearing when  
he was painted by Gainsborough, seemingly entered  
the mind and soul of Sancho as he entertained an  
audience to scenes from Sancho’s life. This was based  
on his book, The Secret Diaries of Charles Ignatius  
Sancho .  
The reenactment took place in the same St Margaret’s  
Church, where Sancho was married, which has  
barely changed from the original. As Paterson walked  
up and down the aisle he was literally walking in the  
footsteps of Sancho when he married his beloved  
bride, Anne. Westminster Abbey completed the reality  
of the occasion by displaying the actual marriage and  
baptismal documents of Sancho’s family at the back  
of the church.  
Sancho’s letters (published after his death), and  
Equiano’s autobiography both became best-sellers  
subscribed to by a dizzy list of the great and the good  
that might have stepped out of Debrett’s. The 1,200  
subscribers to Sancho’s book included leading dukes,  
earls and duchesses, the Prime Minister, Lord North,  
and the historian Edward Gibbon, author of The  
Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.  
A surprising number of the subscribers, such as William  
Beckford, were actually slave owners. Whether this  
was part of their journey towards abolition, mere  
curiosity, or an example of\`English hypocrisy is a moot  
point.  
In one of his final letters, Sancho described the  
Gordon Riots that started after Lord Gordon, an  
eccentric Scottish peer, presented a peaceful petition  
to Parliament, a few hundred yards from Sancho’s  
shop. He was protesting about the Government’s  
plans to make it easier for Roman Catholics to join the  
army. Ironically, many already had joined, thanks to a  
shortage of people willing to enlist.  
Gordon progressed to Parliament with the petition  
after a meeting on Kennington Common attended  
by an estimated 60,000 people. What started off as  
a religious movement led by Gordon against quite  
minor relaxations of the strict rules stopping Roman  
Catholics from taking part in public life, exploded into  
the worst disturbances London had witnessed since  
58 59The Gordon Riots  
the Peasants’ Revolt in 1381\. Thorney Island and the  
rest of central London had seen nothing like it.  
From nearby King Charles Street where he lived and  
near where the riots started, Sancho gave a blow-by-  
blow report of what he saw happening, referring to  
the “maddest people that the maddest times were ever  
plagued with”. He added: “Government is sunk in  
lethargic stupor—anarchy reigns . . . the Fleet prison,  
the Marshalsea, King’s-Bench, both Compeers (small  
debtors’ prisons), Clerkenwell and Tothill Fields, with  
Newgate are all flung open and 300 felons from  
thence only let loose upon the world”.  
Equiano’s book, a riveting blow-by-blow account of his  
experience of slavery, was also a dizzying success,  
attracting over 300 subscribers including the Prince of  
Wales, the Duke of York, Josua Wedgwood, Granville  
Sharp, the Duke of Montagu, William Sancho (the son  
of Ignatius Sancho), and Ottobah Cugoano, the active  
abolitionist operating from Richard Cosway’s studio  
backing on to St James’s Park.  
to each other for a short period. Sancho was living  
in Canon Row when Equiano purchased his freedom  
and Sancho married Ann in St Margaret’s Church in  
1758 a year before Equiano was baptised there aged  
12\. If they ever saw each other they would certainly  
have had lots to talk about, but whether they did or  
not will have to await more research perhaps even  
the discovery of more letters. Meanwhile both of them  
have plaques in St Margaret’s Church cementing their  
links with Thorney Island.  
The success of Sancho and Equiano was likely due  
to their own determination and because both of them  
were helped by mentors. Cugoano’s memoirs, which  
also attracted a long list of subscribers are sometimes \-  
rather bizarrely \- criticised for their lapses in grammar,  
a curious criticism of someone who emerged from  
slavery to write an acclaimed denunciation of slavery  
in a second language. Cugoano was the most radical  
of the abolitionists as he campaigned not just for the  
abolition of the international trade in slaves but for the  
abolition of slavery itself.  
Cugoano also raised the delicate question of the  
layers of guilt in the slave trade. He admitted: ‘I must  
own, to the shame of my own countrymen, that I was  
first kid-napped and betrayed by some of my own  
complexion, who were the first cause of my exile and  
slavery; but if there were no buyers there would be  
no sellers”. He knew that some of the Africans in his  
country kept slaves but claimed “they were well-fed,  
and good care taken of them”.  
At the time, these memoirs were promoted as examples  
of what black people could achieve if only they were  
given the chance, a proposition that still rings urgently  
true today.  
18: The haunting presence of Shakespeare  
on Thorney Island  
On Monday, 11th May 1612, William Shakespeare  
visited Thorney Island though he probably wouldn’t  
have known it by that name. This was the day he  
was summoned to the Court of Requests \- a sort of  
small claims court \- in the White Chamber adjacent  
to Westminster Hall. He gave evidence in a dispute  
between two inhabitants of a house in Silver Street,  
Cripplegate, where he was a lodger. It was about the  
time he was writing one of his last plays \- The Tempest  
\- so he may have had to take time off.  
This was a small case for the Court of Requests, but  
a bigger one for Shakespeare scholars. The house in  
Silver Street is the only place we know for certain that  
Shakespeare actually lived in. Nothing of it remains,  
but its location is in an underground car park in  
London Wall.  
Cugoano knew Equiano, who helped him write his  
book but, curiously, we don’t know whether Sancho  
Fig 17: The fireplace in the Jerusalem Chamber where Henry lV died in Shakespeare’s play and in real lifeand Equiano ever met even though they lived close  
60 61been performed at Court were The Comedy of Errors,  
Measure for Measure, Love’s Labours Lost, Othello,  
the Merry Wives of Windsor and The Tempest all of  
which would have probably needed the presence  
of the author. The Cockpit on the other side of the  
road was sometimes used for theatrical performances  
especially by the young Prince of Wales.  
Shakespeare occasionally inserted local references  
into his plays as in Henry Vlll, which he jointly wrote  
with John Fletcher. When the First Gent rebukes his  
colleague for wrongly calling Cardinal Wolsey’s  
former palace “York Place”, he says:  
“For since the Cardinal fell, that title’s lost:  
tis now the King’s and called Whitehall.”  
Sanctuary (freedom from arrest) in order to join his  
brother, the future Edward V, in the Tower of London.  
In Shakespeare’s play, supported by the opinion of  
Sir Thomas More, the Princes were murdered on  
the orders of Richard lll in order to block their rival  
claims to the succession. That sounds feasible and  
has been repeated in books and taught in schools  
around the world ever since. It is an interesting case of  
Shakespeare not only recording history, but shaping  
the way we think about it.  
But is Shakespeare’s version true?  
A team led by Phillipa Langley \- in a Channel 4  
documentary in November 2023 \- strongly argued,  
apparently with authenticated documents from  
Continental archives, that the Princes escaped from  
the Tower of London to Europe and returned to  
England with armed support under the disguises of  
Lambert Simnel as the deposed Edward V, elder son of  
King Edward IV, and four years later Perkin Warbeck  
claiming to be Richard, Duke of York, the second  
son of Edward lV. If true, Richard would have had  
a rightful claim to the throne if his elder brother had  
died, as was likely, during his failed rebellion.  
Phillipa Langley’s claims have been taken seriously  
because of her earlier success in finding the remains  
of Richard lll in a Leicester car park.  
There has, of course, always been something enigmatic  
about Shakespeare. After all, over 400 years after  
his death, experts are still arguing about whether he  
actually wrote the plays attributed to him, including  
leading actors such as Sir Mark Rylance and Sir Derek  
Jacobi. It is the longest whodunit in literary history.  
The Court of Requests where Shakespeare spoke  
During the course of the case, Shakespeare had  
to make a statement which was taken down by a  
clerk for him to sign. As Charles Nicholl points out  
in his splendid book, The Lodger, this event close to  
Westminster Hall is the only time that Shakespeare’s  
actual spoken words were recorded, as opposed to  
the thousands of lines he had written. His scrawly  
signature at the bottom was the first he had made  
though five others were found subsequently. The words  
he uttered were rather banal. He didn’t speak, as he  
often wrote, in iambic pentameters.  
Shakespeare left more than fleeting footprints on  
Thorney Island. His troupe performed nearly 200  
times at court, which mainly meant the grand hall in  
Whitehall, a stone’s throw from the core of Thorney  
Island, just behind today’s Banqueting House.  
It is highly likely that Shakespeare would have  
attended rehearsals and performances even if he was  
Most of his plays took place abroad, but several were  
actually located on Thorney Island and have affected  
our view of history. Two of them, Richard lll and Henry  
lV (part 2\) happened in different parts of the rooms of  
the Dean of Westminster Abbey called Cheynegates,  
both of which can be viewed today, at least from the  
outside.  
In Henry lV (part 2), Shakespeare set a vital scene  
in the Jerusalem Chamber (fig 17\) where Henry lV  
was dying and where the future Henry V comes in  
and, wrongly thinking his father was dead, tries on  
the crown which, whether true or false, has governed  
the way we think of it ever since. The scene took place  
by the same fireplace as in the recent photo (above)  
taken in the Jerusalem Chamber.  
In Shakespeare’s Richard lll \- as happened in real life  
\- the Queen of England, Elizabeth Woodville, who  
had taken refuge in the Sanctuary of the Abbey at  
Cheynegates, was persuaded to let her son Richard  
leave the Abbey, where they had both claimed  
not acting in them. Among the plays known to have  
Cheyneygates where Elizabeth Woodville sought sanctuary62 63A large majority of scholars still believes that  
Shakespeare was the author, despite some of the  
obvious worries, such as \- how on earth could a man  
from a background of illiteracy have written so many  
plays, with such detailed knowledge of so many  
subjects and places here and abroad?  
A curious factor is the number of the authors put  
forward as rival claimants who have some sort of link  
with Thorney Island. At school, I thought Francis Bacon,  
who would have been a familiar sight in Whitehall,  
was the true author because the obscure Latin word  
in Love’s Labours Lost, honorificabilitudinitatibus, was  
claimed to be an anagram of: “Hi ludi, F. Baconis  
nati, tuiti orbi”, translated as “These works, born of  
Francis Bacon are preserved for the world”.  
That lasted until someone used the same letters in the  
same anagram to prove that the real author was Ben  
Jonson, a local Westminster boy who was educated  
at Westminster School and is buried, standing up, in  
the Abbey.  
Other candidates include Sir Henry Neville who lived  
in Tothill Street which led to the western entrance to  
Thorney, and was an active member of Parliament  
across the road, and William Stanley, 6th Earl of  
Derby, a member of the Privy Council and patron of  
Derby’s Men who performed at court. Christopher  
Marlowe, another candidate, would have been  
familiar with Whitehall whether due to his activities  
as a spy or as a playwright. Mary Herbert, Countess  
of Pembroke, one of the few female contenders for  
the authors, had connections to Westminster through  
her position as a prominent noblewoman and literary  
patron in Elizabethan and Jacobean England. Even  
Queen Elizabeth I has been mentioned as a candidate,  
as has Amelia Lanier (mentioned elsewhere) and Sir  
Walter Raleigh who was executed in Old Palace Yard  
and buried in St Margaret’s Church.  
Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford, the current  
favourite, was a frequent presence in Whitehall as Lord  
Chamberlain and was married in the Royal Palace.  
The list could go on. None of them has a proven claim  
to the authorship, but is it too much to speculate that  
the authorship question might have been a source  
of gossip among themselves? Shakespeare is almost  
certainly the true author and even if he isn’t, it is likely  
to have been someone else with a Thorney Island link.  
Shakespeare is not buried in Westminster Abbey,  
although he has a memorial there, installed well over  
100 years after his death. His remains are in his local  
church Holy Trinity in Stratford upon Avon despite  
efforts from time to time to have him moved to what is  
regarded by some as his spiritual home in the Abbey.  
This has given rise to suggestions that Shakespeare has  
a kind of ethereal presence in the Abbey, not because  
he is buried there but because he isn’t. Poets’ Corner  
is known around the globe for celebrating all that is  
memorable about our poets and playwrights except  
for one: the greatest of them all: William Shakespeare.  
However, visitors could be passing actual mementos  
of Shakespeare without realising it. When Edmund  
Spenser was buried in Poets Corner, according to the  
contemporary historian William Camden, his hearse  
was attended by poets and “mournfull Elegies and  
Poems with the Pens that wrote them thrown into his  
Tomb”. It is a reasonable assumption that Shakespeare  
could have been among these poets in which case  
the pen that Shakespeare used and possibly an elegy  
written in his own hand could still be lying in Spenser’s  
tomb.  
But, wait. In 1938, the Francis Bacon Society got  
permission to open up Edmund Spenser’s grave to  
solve this problem once and for all but there was a  
new problem: they got the wrong tomb. The mystery  
rolls on.  
19: The tragic tale of a little known King  
of England, Harold Harefoot  
Harold Harefoot with the pet hare which gave him his nickname  
Harold Harefoot is one of the saddest stories of

brother, Harthacnut, still seething with rage that he

feuding sons of King Cnut (or Canute) and he ruled  
from Denmark with a fleet of 60 ships to re-enforce his

After being crowned, he had Harold’s body exhumed  
and was buried in St Peter’s Abbey, a precursor to  
only a few months after his death, then beheaded,  
Westminster Abbey.  
and thrown into the River Thames or into a fen

to contemporary accounts, the  
body was retrieved from the river  
by a fisherman and reburied at St.  
Clement Danes Church in the Strand,  
which was a destination for Danes  
in London. The spot where he was  
buried in St Clements, if indeed he  
was, has not yet been found. What  
it clearly needs is for a team like the  
one that found Richard lll’s corpse  
under a carpark in Leicester to get  
cracking.  
We don‘t know much about what  
Harefoot did during his reign, partly  
because he was ill much of the time  
and partly because the history of  
the period was initially written by  
the “winners” from the Harthacnut  
camp. It is maybe for this reason that  
some historians have speculated not  
on what he did but on what might  
have happened if he had not died  
so quickly in his early 20s.  
The death throes of Harthacnut  
The argument goes something like  
this:  
Had Harold lived and kept hold of his throne then Harthacnut might never have returned to England in which  
case Edward the Confessor would never have returned from Normandy. If there had been no King Edward  
it would probably have meant no Norman conquest and no William the Conqueror. Sometimes the “ifs” of  
history are more interesting than the actuality.  
Fate didn’t smile too kindly on Harthacnut either. He collapsed and died at a wedding celebration for his friend  
Tovi the Proud, a rich Danish official, across the river from Thorney Island in Lambeth. He died, aged only 24,  
from an excess bout of alcohol, or a heart attack, or both. Be warned.  
20: Meet the French governor of Duck  
Island in St James’s Park  
Duck Island, St James’s Park  
66 67One of the curious inhabitants of Poets’ Corner in Westminster  
Abbey \- established to laud the achievements of English  
poetry \- is a French nobleman Charles de Martguetel de  
Saint-Denis, seigneur de Saint-Évremond. He apparently  
spoke little or no English and, according to the critic Irving  
Lowens, he wrote “sparkling French prose and facile French  
verse”. He was also a skeptic who refused the last rltes.  
Saint-Évremond was buried \- against his desire for a  
modest funeral \- in Westminster Abbey a few yards from  
the memorial to Shakespeare who was interred in his local  
church, Holy Trinity in Stratford-upon-Avon. How come  
Saint-Évremond managed to be buried in the Abbey?  
It is, of course, not what you know, but who you know.  
Saint-Évremond became a buddy of Charles ll, not least  
because he introduced Charles to French champagne which  
he became very fond of. One should add that this was  
not champagne as we know it today, because it had no  
bubbles. French wine bottles in those days were too fragile,  
and would burst if there was a secondary fermentation,  
whereas Britain, using coal-fired kilns rather than wood-  
fired ones was able to make much stronger bottles, which is  
how the English came to invent the “methode champenoise”  
at least 20 years before the French.  
Historians are not agreed on whether Charles ll was a good  
French speaker, but he must have been proficient as his  
mother was French and he spent nine years of his exile in  
France. Saint-Évremond had fled from France in disgrace  
in the early 1660s, after incurring the wrath of Cardinal  
Mazarin during the reign of Louis lV. He soon became a  
social success among aristocrats in London.  
Charles ll did an extraordinary thing. He made Saint-  
Évremond Governor of Duck Island in St James Park where  
ducks were lured into captivity using decoys before being  
served at the King’s table. Duck Island was, and still is, tiny.  
The governorship for which he was paid £300 guineas a  
year, a lot of money in those days, must have been the  
smallest and most easily governable territory in Britain, if  
not the world.  
St Évremond’s tomb. Shakespeare’s memorial is on the  
other side of the wall  
Évremond wasn’t the only governor of Duck Island. In 1773  
Queen Caroline revived the post by giving it to Stephen  
Duck, an agricultural labourer known as the “Thresher Poet”  
a kind of Rabbie Burns of the West Country. Who says  
monarchs don’t have a sense of humour? Sadly, Duck of  
Duck Island did not achieve the lasting fame of Burns, nor  
was he buried in Westminster Abbey.  
Évremond’s name is enjoying a mini revival. The French  
champagne house Tattinger co-purchased a large acreage  
of prime agricultural land in Kent to take advantage of how  
global warming has boosted the UK’s ability to make good  
wines, particularly sparkling. The new wine is to be called  
Domain Evremond. What Charles de St. Denis, Seigneur  
de Saint Evremond, would have said about a Champagne  
that was sparkling and not still, as he knew it, can only be  
guessed at.  
21: The tallest tomb in the Abbey  
This is the memorial and grave of Henry Carey, the  
first Baron Hunsdon (1526-1596) and his extended  
family. It is the tallest of many tall monuments in the  
Abbey reaching 36 feet, made of alabaster and  
marble with an all-embracing motto (in French) “As I  
find it.”  
Hunsdon himself, it is fair to point out, wasn’t what  
you might expect. He was the illegitimate son of  
Mary Boleyn (sister of Anne Boleyn) and some say of  
Henry Vlll himself. Hunsdon proved himself a brave  
soldier and was festooned with well paid jobs. From  
1594 until his death in 1596 he was patron of the  
Lord Chamberlain’s Men, the company for which  
Shakespeare wrote many of his plays and which  
became the King’s Men under James l: but whenever I  
look at this tomb I am thinking of someone else.  
The inscription on Hunsdon’s monument refers to ”his  
dearest wife” Anne with whom he had 10 or possibly  
13 children. There is no reference, unsurprisingly, to  
his dearest mistress, Amelia Lanier, who is of some  
interest in her own right. She was Hunsdon’s mistress  
for at least for ten years from 1587 when she was 18  
years old.  
It ended when she became pregnant and was married  
off by Hunsdon to a cousin of hers, Alphonse Lanier,  
with a generous settlement (though the affair apparently  
continued). He was over 40 years older than her but it  
appears to have been a happy relationship. She lived  
partly at Hunsdon’s palace, Somerset House, between  
the Strand and the Thames and partly in Longditch  
(today’s Storey’s Gate) on the edge of Thorney Island.  
Amelia was thought for a while by some experts to  
have been the dark lady of Shakespeare’s sonnet  
130 and by others, such as John Hudson, author of  
“Shakespeare’s Dark Lady” to have been the actual  
author of Shakespeare’s works. (Details in Chapter

70 7123: Westminster School \- the history  
behind the wealth and celebrities  
Westminster School can give rise to different  
conversations. It is embarrassingly well endowed with  
resources at a time when the country is supposed to be  
aiming to be a fairer place. It is also well known as a  
producer of celebrated people on an industrial scale.  
They range from Ben Jonson and Christopher Wren  
back then, to recent alumni A A Milne, John Spedon  
Lewis, founder of the John Lewis Partnership, Helena  
Bonham Carter and a clutch of Nobel Prize winners,  
not to mention seven prime ministers in between.  
What is less well known is the wealth of history within  
its walls as it is a busy school only open to the public  
on a few visits a year.  
Parts of the school’s buildings date to the 11th century,  
even older than most of the current Abbey.  
A good place to start is Dean’s Yard, which is open  
to the public, from its entrance on Parliament Square  
near the Abbey shop. After a few yards you can turn  
left past College Hall, now used as a dining room by  
boarding pupils. It is reckoned to be one of the finest  
examples of a medieval refectory anywhere. It was  
where Elizabeth l used to come to witness Westminster  
pupils performing their traditional play in Latin,  
It was part of Cheynegates, the Dean of Westminster’s  
traditional residence,claimed to be the oldest surviving  
continuously occupied residence in London. It stretches  
along one side of Dean’s Yard to the entrance to the  
Cloisters which is also the entrance to the historic  
Cellarium café which is open to the public. It was  
in Cheynegates where another queen, Elizabeth  
Woodville, wife of Edward lV, twice sought sanctuary  
most famously in 1483 with her daughters and son  
Richard, who with his brother, the future Edward V,  
became the Princes in the Tower of London.  
Curiously, no one seems to agree when the school was  
actually started but it is likely to have been around  
1179 when Pope Alexander lll made it compulsory for  
monasteries to encourage education.  
Since then, Henry Vlll is credited with  
founding the school, or at least ensuring  
that it continued after the Reformation,  
but Elizabeth l is regarded by many  
as more important as the re-founder  
of the school. The aim was to educate  
poor children, an ambition that was re-  
affirmed by Elizabeth whose statutes  
declared that 40 scholars should  
be chosen based on “gentleness of  
disposition, ability, learning, good  
character and poverty”. The school  
tries to maintain these principles,  
though poverty has been somewhat  
neglected since, at the time of writing,  
fees are now over £50,000 a year for  
boarders.  
But if the school has drifted from its  
educational moorings, its buildings  
are a constant reminder of its medieval  
heritage.  
If you continue walking along the side  
of Dean’s Yard you will see the original  
Henry Vlll’s faded coat of arms above the original entrance to the school in Dean’s Yard  
entrance to the school in all its faded majesty with  
Henry Vlll’s original coat of arms barely discernible  
above. This was where Alice Liddell, who inspired the  
book Alice in Wonderland was born.  
This is a private part of the school, but if you manage to  
get on to one of the official visits you would go through  
the entrance and soon come across a reception room  
under which the remains of the 40ft square Great  
Kitchen of the monastery dating back to the 1060s  
have been preserved under thick glass.  
College Hall where Elizabeth l witnessed Westminster pupils perform a  
play in Latin  
It was built in the 15th century, but is on the site of an  
the time of William the Conqueror.  
One nearby door led to the misericord (Latin for “act  
of mercy”) where monks could eat meat which was  
forbidden by the rules of St Benedict when they were  
eating in the main dining hall.  
Close by is Little Dean’s Yard, regarded as the centre  
of activities for pupils between lessons. It is dominated  
on one side by Ashburnham House which once  
contained the Cotton Library, a unique collection of  
books which was a crucial founding donation to the  
British Museum (since moved to the British Library). Theearlier one first constructed during the 1060s around  
72 73a few years later he tried to pull down Saint Margaret’s  
church for the same reason, but was repulsed. It turns  
out that the Abbey itself dismantled the wall but left  
the other one standing as it was part of the cloister on  
the other side.  
The biggest feature of the school is the main hall,  
originally built in the 1090s as a dormitory for the  
monks and now used for assemblies, plays and  
prayers. Kim Philby, the spy, once took part in a play  
in the hall. Pupils were taught here from 1599 with the  
upper and lower schools separated by a curtain hung  
from a 16th century pig iron bar which Wikipedia  
assures us “remains the largest piece of pig iron in  
the world”. That is almost the main memory carried  
away from this historic room that is curiously lacking  
in strong visual impact partly due to the coats of arms  
of former pupils spreadeagled around the walls.  
This is a fitting place to say Goodbye to a spectacularly  
successful academic school, replete with history which  
perhaps has yet to come to terms with a slowly changing  
society. It is almost grotesquely endowed with facilities  
compared with neighbouring state schools.  
Part of the medieval kitchen  
collection was moved here from elsewhere to protect  
it from possible fire hazards only itself to be hit by a  
fire at Ashburnham in 1721 which destroyed some of  
its priceless treasures. This is described in more detail  
in chapter XX but it is worth pointing out that it was  
called Ash-burn-ham long before the accident.  
The real gem of Ashburnham is in its garden, a step  
back in time where you can see remains of the actual  
medieval wall of the monks’ refectory at the back,  
partially obscured by a tree. Early meetings of MPs in  
the embryonic Parliament were shunted from place to  
place, depending on what was available, including  
the Painted Chamber and the Chapter House, but the  
refectory became the regular place for meetings of  
the Commons for many years until MPs moved into  
St Stephen’s Chapel in the 16th century. The tiny  
protrusion on the left of the photo is part of the roof of  
the school’s Eton Fives court where the curious game  
of Eton Fives is still played.  
What happened to the other Refectory wall on the  
nearside which would have occupied much of the  
lawn? There was a theory that it was pulled down by

74 7524: The huge fortune behind this tomb at  
St Margaret’s church  
St Margaret’s Church yard in Parliament Square is not  
short of famous dead bodies. It is the resting place  
of William Caxton, Sir Walter Raleigh, Wenceslaus  
Hollar, the brilliant engraver of London, and the  
largest number of regicides (of Charles l) you’ll find  
anywhere.  
But of all the hundreds of people buried in the precinct,  
curiously, there is only one tomb that is above ground.  
It is near the road obscured by a plane tree and  
usually completely ignored by passers-by. It is the  
source of the greatest property wealth this country  
has ever known, which helped to influence the shape  
of London. Here lies Alexander Davis, (or Davies)  
father of Mary Davis \- who is also buried here (as  
Mary Tregonwell). He was a scrivener, who died of  
the plague, heavily in debt, in July 1665 but owning  
quite a bit of land. Mary, who was only seven months  
old when he died, eventually inherited 500 acres of  
what was then regarded as almost worthless pasture,  
meadow and swamp land, but which we know today  
as Belgravia, Pimlico and Mayfair. It also included  
land along Millbank where Peterborugh House  
The Grosvenors’ London pad along Millbank  
(below) was constructed which eventually became the  
London mansion of the Grosvenors until they moved  
into Grosvenor Square.  
If you adjust for inflation and value Mary’s inheritance  
(which is still in the Grosvenor family) at today’s values  
it would have laid the ground for Thorney Island’s first  
billionaire and quite possibly the first potential female  
Britain’s biggest estate until, still mentally  
ill, she died in 1730\. Somewhat ironically,  
the vast estate bequeathed by a woman  
was then passed on down the Grosvenor  
line through a succession of eldest sons. It  
was ever thus.  
billionaire anywhere.  
To cut a long and complicated story short, Mary,  
having apparently been betrothed to someone else  
earlier aged 7, was married aged 12 to a little known  
baronet in the north, Sir Thomas Grosvenor, who at  
the time was busy building his family seat, Eaton Hall.  
By all accounts they had a happy 20 years together

The Grosvenor’s estate at Millbank76 7725: Sir Peter Warren, Thorney Island’s  
unsung billionaire MP  
In 1716, a boy from Warrenstown, County Meath  
in Ireland joined the British navy, aged only 13 as  
an ordinary seaman. This was illegal as both of his  
parents were Catholics, which should have disbarred  
him from the English navy in those days \- but they let  
that pass. By the end of a distinguished naval career,  
he became a very rich man owning over a thousand  
acres in America, including 300 acres in Greenwich  
Village. At today’s prices he would quite likely be a  
Thorney Island billionaire.  
Sir Peter Warren has one of the most extraordinary  
tombs in Westminster Abbey, with a highly unusual  
sculpture to commemorate him accompanied by an  
epitaph by Dr Johnson no less. It represents Hercules  
placing a bust of Sir Peter, made by the distinguished  
French sculptor Roubiliac, on a pedestal watched  
over by an erotically clad female figure representing  
Navigation. Roubiliac carried realism to the extreme  
by leaving marks from smallpox on Warren’s face. The  
model for Hercules, believe it or not, was a bare knuckle  
fighter Jack Broughton who, rather surprisingly, is also  
buried in the Abbey. There is a plaque on the floor of  
the East Cloister to commemorate his achievements.  
Sir Peter did not come from quite as humble a  
background as may have been suggested. The fact  
that “Warren” came from “Warrenstown” gives a  
clue that this wasn’t a typical rags to riches story,  
but that takes nothing away from his extraordinary  
achievements. To cut a long story short, after being  
brought up by his Catholic parents as a Protestant in  
order to have a future at sea, he had a distinguished  
naval career ending up as Admiral of the Fleet  
patrolling American waters to keep the French Navy  
out. Among the successes of his team were the capture  
of 24 ships in four months in 1744 and supporting  
the forces of Massachusetts in capturing Louisbourg  
from the French after a 47 day siege in 1745\. This  
expedition not only earned him a knighthood and  
promotion to rear-Admiral, but a small fortune as well.  
In those days officers were allowed to keep much  
of the booty won and this, together with gifts and a  
bit of land speculation enabled Warren to acquire  
thousands of acres in America including 300 acres  
in what we today call Greenwich Village where he  
built a mansion for himself and his rich American wife  
Susannah Delancey.  
A New York website completes the story: “It was  
in 1747 that our hero was summoned to London,  
to enter Parliament from 1747 to 1752 (as MP for  
Westminster) and from that time on was a bright  
particular star in English society. Known as “the richest  
man in England,” he was a truly magnificent figure  
in a magnificent day. Lady Warren, who was still a  
beauty and a wit, was a great favourite at Court, and  
writers of the day declared her to be the cleverest  
woman in all England”.  
The towns of Warren, Rhode Island and Warren,  
New Hampshire are named after him as are streets  
in Charleston, South Carolina, Louisbourg and New  
York City. Warren Street off Tottenham Court Road,  
commemorates Sir Peter‘s wife.  
Little known fact: George Bernard Shaw said that a  
scandal in this street inspired the name of the leading  
character in his play Mrs Warren’s Profession.78 7926: How two medieval schools on Thorney  
survived until today  
This is about two  
pioneering 17th  
century schools  
around Thorney  
Island which opened  
within ten years  
of each other and  
which are still with  
us today in one  
form or another.  
They are distinct  
from Westminster  
School, a public  
the Sanctuary in 1624, but the culture of  
criminality it engendered just moved a few  
roads away to the area around Old Pye  
Street. This was the centre of what Charles  
Dickens later popularised as the “Devils’  
Acre” which was close to Greycoat School.  
Like the Blewcoat School, Greycoats was  
funded by eight local parishioners, to teach  
the poor of the parish to become workers,  
good citizens and solid Christians. Initially it  
was just for boys, but in 1701 the governors  
purchased an old workhouse in Tothill Fields  
to found a school for boys and girls called  
Greycoat Hospital. It is still there today,  
now a top rated all-girls Comprehensive  
school, on the same site though in a more  
modern building. Part of its heritage still  
survives to remind everyone of its history.

called St Matthew’s  
Street) by voluntary  
subscription which  
The beautiful Blewcoat School from the back

likely a reference to William Green (or Greene), a local  
Thorney Island. Being within the Sanctuary meant that it

of the workhouse.  
In the case of the Blewcoat School, the pupils eventually  
became part of an amalgamation which led to integration  
with others to become today’s Westminster City School, but  
their actual original building is still there in all its glory in  
Caxton Street, a gem among the suffocating tower blocks  
around it, the only late 17th century building in that part of  
Westminster.  
These schools were pioneering. They were not the first of  
their kind because a similar free school had been founded  
in 1512 at the Savoy, but that was by a King (Henry Vll),  
not by individuals. They were at the forefront of a process  
which centuries later would evolve into a national network  
of free schools.  
Both Blewcoat and Greycoat schools \- not to mention the  
Brown Coat, Green Coat, and Black Coat Schools \- all  
sprung from the “turf wars“ among religious schools in the  
17th century when Catholics and Protestants vied to enlist  
poverty-stricken children growing up in the slums at a time  
when there was no state education.  
An excerpt from a parchment roll from around 1700 says  
it all:  
“In the late reign, the Roman Catholick Priests and Jesuites  
were busie in making Proselytes and to that end set up Free  
Schools in the Savoy and other places in and about the City  
of London inviting all poor children to be educated by them  
gratis…”  
Anglicans responded in kind. If street kids were to be given  
an education for nothing then it had better be Anglican and  
not Roman Catholic.  
It was from such philanthropic beginnings that our present  
system of secular and religious education took shape.  
At a time when most of Westminster has been subjected to  
extensive rebuilding we should be grateful that the buildings  
of three schools dating back over many centuries are still  
there: Westminster (public) school, Blewcoat School and  
Greycoat Hospital School.  
80 8127: The Devil’s Acre. Fagin’s den and the  
deepest depths of depravity  
Thorney Island undoubtedly had its own problems,  
host as it was to criminals who could claim Sanctuary  
to avoid arrest, but it was also home to rich people  
associated with Parliament, the law courts, the Abbey  
and for hundreds of years, the royal palace. This  
should not blind us to the utterly horrific conditions  
endured by residents barely a hundred yards away.  
It was almost certainly the biggest contrast of riches  
to poverty anywhere in London or indeed the whole  
country.  
When Charles Dickens called the streets around Old  
Pye Street (pictured below after improvements) “The  
Devil’s Acre” he knew what he was talking about.  
He had been a parliamentary reporter nearby and  
was involved with philanthropists trying to improve  
conditions. Several other parts of London could claim  
to be as destitute – Shoreditch, Saint Giles and Turnmill  
Street for a start – but none had the abominable  
combination of destitution and criminality that have  
darkened this ghetto.  
In the first edition of his Household Words (1850),  
Dickens described the neighbourhood as “begirt by  
scenes of indescribable infamy and pollution; the  
blackest tide of moral turpitude that flows in the capital  
rolls its filthy wavelets up to the very  
walls of Westminster Abbey.”  
J E Smith, vestry clerk of the parish  
of St Margaret and St John the  
Evangelist, gave another grim  
insight: “During the cholera epidemic  
of 1848, a medical gentleman was  
called to visit a sufferer in one of  
the streets on which the church now  
abuts. While stooping over the poor  
creature to administer medicine,  
with which he was provided in  
readiness, his coat pockets were  
emptied of the contents by the dying  
woman’s husband\!” Later during  
the first services in the new church,  
completed in 1851, the inhabitants  
of the notorious alleyways nearby  
interrupted the worship by beating  
empty barrels.  
Thomas Beames in his “The Rookeries of London”  
(1852) wrote that New Court in the Devil’s Acre  
(probably off Old Pye Street) contained twelve houses,  
with six rooms in each: “I have seen and known as  
many as seventy- two persons living in one of these  
houses; and I recollect, in the course of three months,  
sixty-nine young persons being transported, and one  
executed at Newgate, out of No 2”. He added: “I  
might go on describing the streets and courts of the  
district; but, after all I should write, it would give a faint  
idea of what I have witnessed. I have seen upwards  
of forty policemen beat out of Old Pye Street, by the  
inhabitants, while attempting to take a thief”.  
Does 72 people in one house sound unbelievably  
high? The 1861 census for Old Pye Street showed  
a single lodging in this street was home to over 120  
people. Such unbelievably chronic overcrowding was  
partly the result of the construction of Victoria Street  
which was opened in 1851\. New apartments were  
built, but those not lucky enough to gain a flat in the  
new Peabody estates \- which required applicants to  
have a wage-earning job \- were left with nowhere to  
live. Most went across the river to Lambeth but many  
remained to add to the chronic overcrowding of the  
area around Old Pye Street worsened by outbreaks  
of cholera.  
This is how the Revd Richard Malone, Vicar of the  
local church St Matthew’s, described his parish in  
1901, well after the construction of Victoria Street was  
supposed to have improved the area: “The state of  
the streets was appalling; groups of gamblers were  
scattered at every corner and the police dared not  
interfere.”  
He adds of a nearby street: “Many of the houses have  
no flooring in their passages and there is nothing for  
the barefooted children to stand upon at the black  
damp uneven earth. A child, dirty and nearly naked,  
was hanging out the one of the old-fashioned casement  
windows and in the summer time it is no unusual thing  
to see about 50 course women exhibiting themselves  
in the same manner“. He added: “Of all the criminal  
districts in London it is now the worst.”  
The “Devil’s Acre” (shaded yellow) very close to the Abbey precinct  
(dotted line)  
Old Pye Street where the restored houses in the  
painting (above) look like desirable residences for a  
family of four was the bleeding heart of the Devil’s  
Acre.  
This painting was done some time after the  
“improvements” when the new Victoria Street  
bulldozed its way through the slums, but the size of  
each building would have been the same.  
John Hollingshead, who had worked with Dickens on  
Household Words, walked down Old Pye Street to St  
Ann’s Lane which in happier times had been the home  
of Henry Purcell and wrote: “Enter, a narrow street  
called St Anne’s Lane, glance at a fearful side place  
called St Ann’s Court, and wonder if ever such filth  
and squalor can be exceeded. The court had every  
Old Pye Street in the late 19th century  
feature of a sewer, and a long puddle of filth soaked  
82 83in a hollow centre”. He described Old Pye Street as  
an “openly acknowledged high street of thieves and  
prosti-tutes” and added: “It has no mock modesty  
about it, no desire to conceal its real character.  
Threepenny “homes for travellers” abound on both  
sides-yellow, sickly, unwholesome places, many of  
them far below the level of the road, and entered by  
a kind of pit. Many of the houses have no flooring on  
their passages; and there is nothing for the barefooted  
children to stand upon but the black, damp, uneven  
earth”.  
Further along Old Pye Street in a road called Perkin’s  
Rents was a pub called The One Tun (map above and  
photo below). It was, in effect, a School of Fobology  
(pickpocketing), almost certainly the inspiration for  
Fagin’s Den in Oliver Twist even though the fictional  
version was diplomatically located elsewhere (Jacob’s  
Island). The photo was taken in 1870 when the pub  
had been converted into a ragged school by Adeline  
Cooper, a wealthy philanthropist, backed by Lord  
Shaftesbury, who was shocked by the conditions in the  
Devil’s Acre, particularly the plight of street children.  
It provides a rare photographic example of what the  
street looked like in earlier times. .  
Today’s Speaker pub is marked by a yellow oblong bottom left. Above

It is difficult for us to  
imagine the scale  
of depravity. This  
was at a time when  
Britain was boasting  
about its material  
success to the rest of  
the world, which we  
nowadays realise  
was frequently  
based on the slave  
trade. Under Prince  
Albert’s guidance,  
the Great Exhibition  
of 1851 in Hyde  
Park was not only  
a showpiece for  
Britain’s industrial  
prowess but \- unlike  
similar exhibitions  
around the world  
\- it invited other  
countries to compete  
\- so confident were we of our superiority. This example  
of Britain at its best in Hyde Park was happening only  
a few miles from Britain at its worst \- The Devil’s Acre.  
To his credit, Prince Albert wanted to include in the  
exhibition some model dwellings for poorer people  
but he was overruled by his own board. It wasn’t the  
sort of thing they wanted to draw attention to. Prince  
Albert’s model dwellings were constructed near the  
Great Exhibition, but not in it and were later pulled  
down and transferred to Kennington Park where  
they can still be seen, a forerunner to the Peabody  
buildings.  
How could the men of God (no women apart from  
Queen Victoria) and the rulers of a vast empire have  
One of Prince Albert’s model dwellings for the poor now at Kensington Park  
let this social and moral apartheid happen? We have  
to go back to Edward the Confessor who reigned from  
1042 until 1066\. He founded the Abbey and turned  
the precincts into a sanctuary to which criminals could  
go and be free from the hand of the law. This was  
so well observed that not even kings would dare to  
disregard it under pain of excommunication. James l  
abolished the rights of sanctuary in the early 1600s,  
but the culture of criminality had taken root and helps to  
explain why what became the Devil’s Acre continued  
to attract criminals for centuries afterwards.

84 8528: How the horse trough rescued London  
Newgate on Snow Hill, where it can  
still be observed today (see photo

serving around 7,000 people a day.  
He co-founded and chaired the Metropolitan Drinking  
Fountain and Cattle Trough Association (MDFCTA) in  
1859 with its HQ near Parliament in Victoria Street with  
his co-founder Edward Thomas Wakefield. It provided  
free, clean drinking water for the public and troughs  
for the animals including an estimated 100,000 horses  
in London. Horses were the main means of transport  
and they needed water to survive the day. By 1900,  
the number of working horses in London had soared  
to an astonishing 300,000. Without water troughs.  
London might have ground to a halt. By this time there  
were about 800 horse troughs in London, mainly due  
to the voluntary initiative of the MDFCTA.  
There are reckoned to be over 100 original troughs  
still in London often repurposed as micro-gardens or  
works of art and all of them reminders of the 19th  
century city.  
The first drinking fountain was erected in 1859 on the  
boundary wall of the church of St Sepulchre-without-  
In 1867, the association started to  
include water troughs for animals,  
mainly horses, used for public and  
private transportation and commercial  
deliveries.  
This created a new problem of disposing  
of the thousands of tons of horse  
manure left on the roads. A tongue-  
in-cheek article in The Times in 1894  
predicted that in 50 years “every street  
in London will be buried under nine feet  
of manure”. The problem wasn’t finally  
solved until the coming of mechanised  
cars and lorries in the late nineteenth  
and early twentieth centuries.  
Meanwhile, Gurney’s other pioneering

86 8729: The secret garden that hosted Parliament  
Westminster pupils in front of Ashburnham House  
The garden of Ashburnham House with the medieval refectory wall behind  
The garden of Ashburnham House in Little Dean’s  
Yard, now part of Westminster School, contains a  
priceless piece of history. At the back is one wall of  
the medieval refectory where the monks ate their meals  
and where the embryonic House of Commons met for  
many years. The lower section of the wall dates back  
to the time of Edward the Confessor and the upper  
part to Edward lll.  
Ashburnham House is also remembered for something  
completely different. On 2nd October 1731, a fire  
broke out beneath the library in the house. It contained  
the priceless Cotton collection of books including the  
Lindisfarne Gospels, two copies of the original Magna  
Carta, Sir Gavin and the Green Knight and so on.  
As the flames found their way up the wooden panels,  
the billowing smoke created its own alarm. Among  
the people who rushed to the rescue was an alert  
librarian, who threw a book out of the window in an  
attempt to save it. It was no ordinary book. It was the  
only copy in the world of one of the classics of early  
English literature, Beowulf. The actual manuscript  
was written around 1000 AD, but the poem itself is  
probably much older dating back to as early as 650  
AD.  
Contemporary records report that Dr Richard Bentley,  
who was looking after the Royal Collection, also  
housed at Ashburnham, leaped from a window holding  
under one arm the priceless Codex Alexandrinus, a  
5th-century Greek manuscript containing most of the  
Old and New Testaments.  
Whether he was the same person who saved Beowulf  
is not clear but together they helped to save the  
majority of the books and manuscripts \- all collected  
by the indefatigable Sir Robert Cotton (1571–1631)  
\- which later formed the heart of the collections of the  
British Library.  
Thirteen manuscripts were lost and over 200 others  
suffered severe destruction and water damage. One  
of the worst losses was a unique manuscript of the Life  
of King Alfred the Great.  
It is one of the minor ironies of history that the Cotton  
collection had been moved to the inappropriately  
named Ash-burn-ham House for safekeeping.  
There had been a building on the site of Ashburnham  
House since the 11th century. It took its name from  
Charles Ashburnham, a Royalist friend of Charles II  
88 8930: The Chapter House; a building  
“beyond compare”  
The Chapter House of Westminster Abbey has a good  
claim to be one of the most important small buildings  
in the country. It is best seen from Old Palace Yard in  
its full glory when the trees in front have shed their  
leaves in winter. It is interesting enough in its own  
peerless shape before looking at its history. It was built  
by Henry III in the mid 1250s as part of his vision to  
reconstruct the Abbey. It was a place where the monks  
could meet every day to read a “chapter” from the rule  
of St Benedict before discussing what was to happen  
during the rest of the day. It was octagonal in shape  
replacing an earlier round chapter house constructed  
by Edward the Confessor in 1050\. It has been  
described by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott as “a structure  
perfect in itself”. The medieval monk, Mathew Paris,  
referred to it as “a chapter house beyond compare”.  
The pathway (below) once led to a stall run by William  
Caxton as an adjunct to his printing press situated in  
the Almonry on the other side of the Abbey.  
To see inside the Chapter House, however, you have to  
buy the standard ticket to visit the whole Abbey which  
is £30 at the time of writing. Until a few years ago it  
was free to visit the Chapter House, the Cloisters and  
the historic garden, but it was stopped when it was  
discovered that internet users were explaining how  
you could get into the Abbey itself from the Cloisters  
without paying anything.

who leased it after the Restoration. It became part  
of Westminster School in 1882 when the Dean and  
Chapter bought back the property from the Crown,  
following an acrimonious parliamentary battle over its  
ownership.  
Ashburnham House was the London seat of the family,  
which became the Earls of Ashburnham. It incorporates  
remains of the medieval Prior’s House and its garden  
is the site of the monks’ refectory (photo, above) where  
some of the earliest sittings of the House of Commons  
took place.  
The current building incorporates the remains of the  
medieval Prior’s House, and its garden is the site of  
the former monks’ refectory and some of the earliest  
sittings of the House of Commons including when they  
met there to impeach Piers Gaveston during the reign  
of Edward ll.  
The other wall of the refectory would have occupied  
part of the lawn of the garden. It is still a bit of a  
puzzle why it was pulled down. One unsubstantiated  
theory is that it was demolished by Protector Somerset  
to provide material for his proposed palace, Somerset  
House, on the Strand.

lovely wall paintings and what is claimed to be one of  
the finest medieval tile pavements in England.  
The wall paintings  
When the Commons moved out the space started to  
be filled with State records and documents. During  
the reign of James I, papers relating to the King’s  
Bench and the Common Pleas were stored, a practice  
that carried on until the end of the 1850s. During  
this period it became a treasure trove of artefacts of  
English history, including the Domesday Book. These  
documents formed the core of the Public Records  
Office until it morphed into the National Archives at  
Kew. It is quite extraordinary for such a small room as  
the Chapter House to have so much history crammed  
into it. It remains a shame at the time of writing that  
the Abbey hasn’t kept access to the Chapter House  
and the garden free of charge, but that is the way of  
the world.  
Dean Stanley observed of the Chapter House that  
“almost all the struggles for liberty against the Crown  
must have taken place within these walls”. This was  
a bit of an exaggeration as the Chapter House was  
too small to accommodate over 200 MPs on a regular  
basis, but it was undoubtedly a key staging post in the  
history of Parliament.  
Inside the Chapter House  
Once inside, at the entrance to the Chapter House  
you pass on your right, what is confidently claimed  
to be the oldest door in Britain. Dendrochronology  
has dated the growth of the wood to between 924  
and 1030 AD so it was well over 30 years before  
William the Conqueror’s arrival in 1066\. It is made  
from five oak planks with recessed battens and is the  
only surviving Anglo-Saxon door in the UK.  
The sublimity of the Chapter House still shines through  
even though most of the wall paintings and floor  
tiles (dating back to the 1250s) have faded and the  
original stained glass windows have been replaced as  
Britain’s oldest door  
The Chapter House was the incubator of two great  
British institutions. The embryonic House of Commons  
met there in 1352 and later in the 1370s when Henry  
III summoned nobles and gentry from the country  
to this room to discuss thorny questions such as the  
raising of taxes, which until then had been the sole  
right of the King. MPs continued to meet there or in  
the monks’ refectory until 1547 after the Reformation  
when Edward VI moved them across the road to St  
Stephen’s Chapel.

92 9331: The unique Painted Chamber.  
It lasted 600 years until the 1834 fire  
However, the work was not actually  
commissioned until about 1292\.  
Unlike the paintings which had been  
commissioned by his father, the murals  
painted for King Edward I, a soldier  
king, were all derived from stories in  
The Painted Chamber, which dates  
back to 1237, was a spectacular part  
of the medieval Palace of Westminster  
until it was destroyed by the Great  
Fire of 1834\. It has been described  
as “perhaps the greatest artistic  
treasure lost in the fire”. Actually, it  
may not have been completely lost  
as some archaeologists think that its  
foundations may be waiting to be  
unearthed \- just behind the statue of  
Richard the Lionheart in Old Palace  
yard.  
It was built by Henry lll as the King’s  
Chamber in a space close to St  
Stephen’s Chapel and included a  
painting of the coronation of Edward  
the Confessor as a feature. This is not  
surprising as it was previously the  
room in which Edward the Confessor  
is said to have died and was intended  
to be the King’s private apartment  
and a reception room to impress  
important visitors.  
Twenty years later, Henry’s eldest  
son, who had become Edward I,  
commissioned a further cycle of wall  
murals with religious themes. The  
murals were influenced by Edward’s  
experience during the Crusades, and

depicted war-like images.  
Over the years they were damaged  
by fire and riots and were eventually  
whitewashed and covered with  
tapestries. This was the state of the  
Painted Chamber as depicted by William  
Capon in the watercolour above.  
The Painted Chamber hosted the so-  
called Good Parliament of 1376  
which has been linked to the Peasants’  
Revolt of 1381\. It attempted to expose  
government corruption which was all for  
the good, but Parliament’s efforts were  
reversed by the highly unpopular John  
of Gaunt stoking public opposition. This  
came at a time of great hardship fanned  
by oppressive impositions like the hated  
Poll Tax, which fueled the grievances  
that led to the Peasants’ Revolt of 1381,  
during which Gaunt’s palace in the  
Strand was destroyed.  
Later, the Painted Chamber was used for

94 9532: How a monastery masterminded the  
biggest heist in British history  
If asked in a pub quiz to name the biggest heist in  
British history most people would probably opt for the  
Great Train Robbery of 8th August 1963\. Great Train  
Robbery? Forget it.  
In the last week of April 1303, over 650 years before,  
was when surely the greatest robbery in British history  
took place. The theft of the King’s Jewels and other  
treasures which had been stored in the crypt under the  
Chapter House and the neighbouring Pyx Chapel of  
Westminster Abbey. Their thick stone walls and fortified  
oak doors were thought to have been impregnable,  
the most secure rooms in the country.  
There, gold and silver were measured in little round  
containers called pyxes. It had two heavy oak doors,  
one behind the other, each with three locks, meaning  
six keys were required to gain admittance.  
The heist had been planned for a year. This gave  
the perpetrators time to do some serious preparation  
including the planting of some fast growing hemp  
seed in the Palace grounds to provide a literal cover-  
up as they planned their crime to burrow into the  
crypt. How much was stolen? The booty was estimated  
at £100,000 in the currency of the day \- worth tens  
of millions of pounds in today’s money. The vaulted  
undercroft \- where the treasure was stored \- still exists  
today and can be viewed by anyone buying a ticket  
(£30 at the time of writing) to visit the Abbey. It dates  
from about 1070 and is the oldest fabric, still standing,  
at Westminster.  
Everything about the storage seemed secure until the  
arrival of Richard of Pudlicott or Pudlicote, also known  
as Richard de Podelicote. He was a “gentleman” wool  
The Pyx Chamber, the oldest fabric in Westminster Abbey  
merchant from Oxfordshire who appeared to have had  
a grudge against King Edward I (known as Ironside or  
“Hammer of the Scots”), dating back to when he had  
been imprisoned in Flanders as a guarantor for the  
monarch’s spiraling debts.  
He had been watching the comings and goings in the  
Abbey, and when King Edward left to fight William  
An engraving apparently depicting Podnecott at work during the robbery  
Wallace (of Braveheart fame) in West Lothian,  
Scotland, his chance had come. Richard planned to  
sneak into the building. Having found a ladder nearby,  
he used it to gain entry to part of the Abbey where he  
stole a number of silver treasures which he sold and  
which whetted his appetite for something bigger.  
So, after months of preparation and tunneling, shielded  
96 97by the hemp hedge he had planted, he waited until it  
was dark on 24th April and he entered the treasury  
for the first time. He remained inside rearranging the  
goods he wished to steal the next day on the 25th.  
With the connivance of a surprising number of monks  
oblivious of the Eighth Commandment (‘Thou shalt not  
steal”), he carried out his plan.  
A day later, he made off with all the bounty he wished  
to keep, burying much of it temporarily beneath a  
cemetery gate behind nearby St Margaret’s church.  
The robbery was obviously an inside job, so Edward  
did what a king has to do. He arrested the Abbot of  
the Abbey and its 48 monks and associated servants,  
as they were the ones with access to the Pyx chamber.  
All were imprisoned in the Tower of London. The  
architectural historian Jeremy Ashbee says that when  
the loot started showing up in brothels and pawn  
shops. Pudlicote was arrested with £2,200 worth of  
stolen goods in his possession, an enormous amount in  
those days. He was sentenced to death in November  
1305, having been carted from the Tower of London  
in a wheelbarrow, and hanged in the precincts of the  
Abbey on the Abbot’s Gallows in Tothill (or Tuttle),  
Lane which appears to have run from Tothill Street  
towards the swampy ground of Tothill Fields.  
Pudlicott was undoubtedly the main perpetrator and  
was executed. He had tried to pretend he acted alone  
to protect the monks, but to no avail. Alongside him,  
a dozen or so others were also hanged including the  
sub Prior and sacrist of the Abbey, but not, curiously,  
one of the leading suspects, William Palmer, who  
was known as William of the Palace because of his  
connections there. He sheltered some of the suspects  
in the Palace and, can you believe it, was also  
deputy keeper of the Fleet Prison. Most of the accused  
managed to escape execution, partly because the  
King did not want to fracture relations with the Abbey  
too much. For an exhaustive account of this unique  
event see Paul Doherty’s book The Great Crown Jewels  
Robbery of 1303\.  
Afterwards, the royal treasures were removed to the  
Tower of London, but only until the undercrofts at the  
Abbey had been reinforced. They were then brought  
back to their historic resting place. Maybe the thinking  
was that, despite everything that had happened at the  
Edward l “Longshanks”  
Abbey, God would still be their best guardian. And  
lightning wouldn’t strike twice.  
33: How shabby Canon Row turned from  
architecture to art and haute cuisine  
What did materialise in Canon Row on the first floor  
of the shabby building in the photograph (above)  
was Britain’s first Architectural Museum which, after  
several moves, later expanded first into a College of  
Art and later into a technical college and then into  
a renowned catering college on Vincent Square. The  
technical college and its catering offshoot were helped  
by donations from the philanthropist Baroness Burdett-  
Coutts and by the active involvement of the great  
French chef Auguste Escoffier and the famed hotelier  
Cesar Ritz. Both were deeply concerned about the lack  
of skilled youngsters opting for a career in hospitality  
(Sounds familiar?).  
The strange beginnings of the Royal Architectural Museum (V\&A)  
The tiny alley known as Canon Row by Westminster  
Bridge is mainly remembered for being the site of  
Canon Row police station but it also marks the little  
known birth of a number of fascinating institutions. It  
may be pushing it a bit too far to claim that Canon  
Row was the parent of British Gas, but it was the site  
for the short-lived first works of The Gas Light and  
Coke Company, the world’s first public gas company,  
which eventually became British Gas. The Canon  
Street project was soon abandoned as too small  
and the company moved to its new headquarters in  
nearby Great Peter Street. However, its origins were  
not forgotten. In 1960, there was a proposal to put  
a plaque on Canon Row police station to mark the  
origin of the gas company, but it did not materialise.  
Canon Row today  
98 99Their foresight led to the establishment of today’s  
prestigious Westminster Kingsway Catering College  
still in Vincent Square where Jamie Oliver and  
countless others learned their trade and where there  
is a highly regarded Escoffier restaurant run by final  
year students in addition to a brasserie run by other  
students.  
It all started with the architectural museum which  
took off in 1851, the year of the Great Exhibition in  
Hyde Park, when the dream of some of Britain’s most  
celebrated architects and artists \- including George  
Gilbert Scott, Sir Charles Barry and John Ruskin \-  
came true. Britain was to have its own architectural  
museum which opened a year later in Canon Row  
and was soon called The Royal Architectural Museum,  
thanks to backing from Queen Victoria and Prince  
Albert. It was totally unlike Prince Albert’s world-  
beating extravaganza in Hyde Park. It began life on  
the upper floor of a dingy building used for stabling  
in Canon Row, a cul-de-sac. It was not destined to win  
any architectural prizes.  
Canon Row, on the edge of Thorney Island, had seen  
better days. It is so named because in medieval times  
it was used to house the Dean and canons from St  
Stephen’s Chapel nearby, each of which had a large  
garden stretching down to the Thames. On some maps  
it is called Channel Row because it led down to the  
Thames, but that was not its real name.  
In the late 16th century it went through its aristocratic  
phase. It had been the home of the statesman William  
Cecil when he worked for Protector Somerset during  
Edward VI’s reign. He left in 1561 when he purchased  
what became the palatial Cecil House on the Strand  
where the Strand Palace hotel now stands. During its  
aristocratic phase, the residents of Canon Row read  
like a roll call from Debrett’s. They included the Earl  
of Derby (at Derby House), the Earl of Hertford (at  
Hertford House), the Earl of Lincoln (at Lincoln House)  
and the Earl of Sussex (at Sussex House).  
Towards the end of the 18th century, Canon Row  
was the home of the black polymath Ignatius Sancho,  
probably because it was near the home of his mentor  
the Duke of Montagu at Montagu Houses. This was  
before Sancho moved across King Street (today’s  
Whitehall) to Charles Street where there is a plaque  
commemorating the grocery shop he ran there. By  
the mid 19th century, Canon Row was clearly in  
decline as can be seen when it became the home of  
the somewhat shabby architectural museum and the  
original Elementary Drawing School.  
Despite these insalubrious beginnings, within two  
years the museum had acquired over 6,000 objects,  
both casts (reproductions) and 250 original works. It  
clearly needed more room. Among the most valuable  
additions were 43 casts from Ruskin’s visit to Venice.  
When a government grant was removed in 1856, the  
Westminster Kingsway Catering College  
museum successfully applied for a rent-free space in  
the new South Kensington Museum (later renamed the  
Victoria and Albert) which had been built with part of  
the profits from the Great 1851 Exhibition.  
At first things went swimmingly at what were known as  
the “‘Brompton Boilers” in South Kensington, until the  
museum ran short of money. The Government refused  
to restore the lost grant unless the museum allowed  
the Government to take over. The museum refused  
and the search for a new site started and eventually  
had a happy conclusion. At a meeting in Westminster  
Abbey’s Jerusalem Chamber (where much of the  
The interior of the architectural museum in Cannon Row  
The architectural museum at 18 Tufton Street (The Builder, 1869\)  
King James Bible was written) a local stonemasonry100 101company offered the museum a 30 year lease on  
premises in Bowling Street (later Tufton Street). The  
museum had come from one end of Thorney Island to  
Kensington and then back to the other end of Thorney  
Island.  
The museum was initially financed by local contributions  
of money and donations of materials. The most  
curious was what Sir Charles Barry received from the  
Lucas brothers \- six 50-foot-span iron supports from  
the 1862 Exhibition building in Kensington (not the  
famous 1851 one) for the basic frame of the Museum  
building and window casements. In addition, supplies  
of Caen stone and steel shutters were proffered by  
local suppliers.  
Mark Liebenrood adds that in keeping with its original  
educational purpose, a school for architectural  
drawing was opened in 1870 and although money  
continued to be a problem the school did well and  
by the 1880s it had 200 students. It was, he says,  
“effectively subsidising the museum and changed  
its name to Westminster School of Art in 1890.” Its  
alumni included Aubrey Beardsley, David Bomberg,  
Duncan Grant, H M Bateman (who wrote The Man  
Who cartoons) and Emily Carr.  
Bateman described it in 1903 as “... arranged on  
four floors with galleries running round a big square  
courtyard, the whole being covered over with a big  
glass roof. Off the galleries were the various rooms  
which made up the school, the galleries themselves  
being filled with specimens of architecture which gave  
the whole place the air of a museum, which of course  
it was.”  
In 1904, the art school moved to Vincent Square  
to merge with the Westminster Technical Institute  
established with the help of Angela Burdett-Coutts.  
It consisted of a Civil Engineering academy and a  
Cookery academy. The School of Hospitality and  
Culinary Arts was founded in 1910 as part of the  
Technical Institute with the help of Escoffier and Cesar  
Ritz.  
Meanwhile, in 1902, the Architectural Association  
took over the building and contents of the Royal  
Architectural Museum in Tufton Street. However, it  
had no long-term enthusiasm for the project and in  
1916 it presented the bulk of its collections to the  
Victoria and Albert Museum (the V\&A) where many  
of them can still be enjoyed today. The Westminster  
Kingsway Catering College is still flourishing today  
and the Westminster School of Art \- which by 1931  
had 654 students making it the largest art school in  
Middlesex \- carried on until 1965 before moving to  
the West London College of Commerce in 1965\.  
It says something about the fascinating growth of  
these organisations that all of them can trace their  
institutional DNA back to a shabby building in Canon  
Row on Thorney Island.  
34: Should the Princes in the Tower really  
be the Princes in the Abbey?  
The most famous person to claim sanctuary in  
Westminster Abbey was Elizabeth Woodville. She was  
a queen in her own right (wife of Edward IV), mother  
of another king (Edward the V, albeit uncrowned) and  
her daughter married yet another king (Henry VII) but  
it is for her stay on Thorney Island – where she twice  
took sanctuary to avoid prison during the Wars of the  
Roses – that she is chiefly remembered. Most famously  
when her husband Edward IV was forced to flee the  
country, she escaped from the Tower of London at night  
and claimed sanctuary twice in the Abbey on October  
1st, 1470 and in April, 1483\. She occupied rooms in  
the Dean’s medieval quarters known as Cheyneygates.  
It is claimed to be the longest continuously occupied  
residence in London and still exists today. (see photo)  
The future King Edward V was actually born in the  
Sanctuary. Many kings have been buried in the Abbey  
precinct, but only one was born there  
He became famous as one of the Princes in the Tower  
who were probably \- but not definitely \- murdered on  
the orders of Richard III who had both motive (getting  
rid of likely claimants for the throne) and opportunity,  
as they were both being held under his protection in  
the Tower of London.  
Elizabeth was duped into letting her son leave the  
sanctuary during her second stay there in order to  
let him join his brother in the Tower of London, as  
dramatically told by Shakespeare in Richard III. It was  
on the spurious grounds that he would be looked after  
and that sanctuaries were for criminals not innocent  
children.  
As the Duke of Buckingham put it to Cardinal Bourchier  
in Shakespeare’s words:  
“This prince hath neither claim’d it (sanctuary) nor  
deserv’d it,  
And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it.  
Then taking him from thence that is not there,  
You break no privilege nor charter there.  
Oft have I heard of sanctuary men,  
But sanctuary children never till now.”  
Elizabeth eventually retired to the Royal apartments  
in Bermondsey Abbey in 1490 where she died two  
years later apparently destitute. She is buried beside  
her husband, Edward IV in St George’s Chapel at  
Windsor.  
Shakespeare’s presumption that Richard lll ordered the  
deaths of the two princes is coming under increasing  
scrutiny. It seemed to gain credence in 1674 when  
workmen discovered two small skeletons underneath  
a staircase in the Tower of London. King Charles ll  
instructed that the bones be re-buried in Westminster  
Abbey where they still are today in the north aisle of  
the Henry Vll Chapel. So, should we be talking about  
the ‘Princes in the Abbey” not the Princes in the Tower?  
The answer is not yet. The skeletons found in the Tower  
have a problematic provenance. An examination  
in 1933, which didn’t have the benefit of modern  
techniques, could not determine the sex or exact age  
of the bones. Modern DNA testing would do better, but  
would need the permission of the Dean and Chapter of  
Westminster Abbey which is unlikely not least because

36: William Caxton, the man who changed  
the face of the English language  
To understand London  
you have to travel outside  
\- and what better place  
to start than the source  
of the Thames, without  
The Thames by St Paul’s Cathedral  
which there would have been no river and no London. But  
where is the real source? The trouble is that when you do get  
to the supposed start of the Thames at Kemble, as mentioned  
above, during the parched summer season there is...  
nothing there. The Thames that you see flowing purposely  
past Thorney Island doesn’t contain anything from its source  
for much of the year. This is also true of Thames Head a few  
miles north of Kemble which is recognised as the official  
source of the Thames by the Ordnance Survey. However, it  
also remains dry for much of the year in hot weather.  
That leaves the third candidate, the River Churn, with a  
strong claim. It rises at Seven Springs in Gloucestershire and  
flows south for around 23 miles before it joins the Thames at  
Cricklade in Wiltshire. Unlike the other two source claimants,  
Thames Head and Kemble, it flows throughout the year.  
Since the distance from the source of the Churn to its  
confluence with the Thames is greater than that of the Thames  
from Kemble or Thames Head, it could be argued that the  
Churn is the source and the Thames merely its tributary,  
This combined river would be eleven miles longer than the  
River Severn and so would qualify to be the longest river  
in the whole country, indeed maybe in the British Isles.This  
would be a bad blow for the River Severn but “Cricklade-  
on-Churn” would be in Seventh Heaven. However, “London-  
on-Churn”? It is difficult even to think about it, but it is still  
a fascinating curiosity that after well over a thousand years  
experts are still arguing where one of the most famous rivers  
in the world actually begins and what its name ought to be.  
This unlikely spot on Thorney Island,  
taken from an 1850s photograph,  
has a fascinating history. The two  
buildings on the left \- George Gilbert  
Scott’s Crimea memorial column  
and his Gothic terrace, are still  
there today. The Royal Aquarium  
on the right which stretched down  
Tothill Street almost to St James’s  
Park station is long gone, as is the  
317 roomed Westminster Palace  
Hotel in the middle. It had the first  
hydraulic lifts in the country and  
was so close to the Abbey that it  
could almost touch it. It claimed  
to have a moderate tariff and no  
charge for “attendance”, whatever  
that meant. Soon after it opened  
in 1860, the newly created India  
Office leased 140 rooms. For seven years until it moved into  
its permanent offices in Whitehall, the state of India was  
ruled from this hotel. At the time of writing, most of the site  
was known as 10 to 20 Victoria Street.  
However, neither of these buildings were as revolutionary as  
what happened on the site of the hotel over 350 years earlier.  
It was then the Almonry where the monks of Westminster  
distributed alms to the poor. It was also where William Caxton  
(1422-1491) set up the first printing press in England. He  
didn’t invent letterpress printing. That was the achievement  
of a German, Johannes Gutenberg in 1450\. The Chinese  
had been doing it centuries earlier, but it was Gutenberg’s  
invention which eventually swept the western world. It led  
to literature being mass produced rather than dependent on  
beautiful but laboriously produced scrolls, mainly by monks.  
It was the start of the information revolution.  
Caxton revolutionised printing in Britain by enabling the bulk  
production of books and documents, but he also changed the  
shape and direction of the English language itself. This was  
because, having broken the monopoly of the monks over the  
written word \- mainly religious tracts and usually not written  
in English \- he had to decide which among all the dialects of  
England, he should choose as a standard so his books could  
be widely understood. He must have been tempted by his  
own Kent brogue, but he opted instead for something nearer  
to a London dialect.  
106 107Caxton himself pointed out the difficulty with a real life  
example of merchants stranded in the Thames for lack of  
wind. One of them asked at a house for ‘eggs’ only to be  
told by the “good wife” that she did not speak French. The  
merchant was annoyed because he could speak no French  
either, but happily one of his colleagues said they would  
have ‘eyren’ which the good wife understood. Happily the  
word eggs triumphed over eyren when Caxton’s English  
ironed out many of the irregularities.

to rent the loft over the Almonry gate and took on a third  
and larger tenement in the precincts. Dr Payne says that  
Caxton’s range as editor, translator, seeker of patronage,  
manager and marketer showed his flexibility but “he owed  
his commercial success less to the quality of his printing than  
to his strategy as a publisher.”

remembered these days by Caxton Hall in nearby Caxton

process with relish and helped England become part of a  
multimedia world. He had become interested in the new

set up a printing press in Bruges where he translated and  
printed The History of Troy before bringing his printing press  
to Westminster in 1476, where he rented a loft over the  
Almonry gate until 1488 when, according to Dr Matthew  
Payne, Keeper of the Muniments at the Abbey, he ceased  
We know Caxton’s main operations were in the Almonry  
partly because the library of Brasenose College in Oxford  
has an original placard (above) of Caxton’s invitation to  
customers to “come to Westmonester into the Almonestrye,  
at the ‘reed pale’”, the name by which Caxton’s House was  
known.  
As a member of the 700-year old Mercers’ Company, he  
would have been expected to to set up his business two miles  
away from Thorney Island in the City of London. Caxton  
thought better. He wanted to be near a potential source of  
demand, and so chose the precincts of Westminster Abbey  
where lawyers, aristocrats, politicians and clergy provided  
a ready market for the post-parchment printed word. Being  
located in Westminster meant he was free from all the petty  
regulations in the City. Caxton had a stall on a path leading  
to the Abbey on the eastern side where the back of the  
Chapter House (picture below) is today. Until recently it had  
a plaque on the wall, but his main operation was on two  
floors of the Almonry.  
The back of the Chapter House where Caxton had a stallTo move from writing one-off scrolls to what became mass  
production with words printed in English not Latin or French,  
was truly revolutionary, akin to today’s revolution in moving  
from analogue to internet-based digital.  
The ability to mass produce meant that at the start there was  
a serious lack of what today would be called “content” which  
helps to explain why so many of Caxton’s early books were  
either foreign or Anglicised versions of foreign publications.  
Caxton was primarily a multi-media businessman who  
enabled knowledge to spread to ordinary people leading to  
a mass market for books, hitherto a monopoly of the monks.  
He wrote or translated countless thousands of words and is  
credited with being the first to use well over 1,000 new words  
in English. This may not be as dramatic an achievement as  
it sounds because so few books had been written in English  
before he set up shop, so it was relatively easy to introduce  
108 109new words. He was responsible for more than a hundred  
editions, most of which were eventually in English, many  
translated by himself.  
Caxton’s first piece of printing in England was not a book,  
but an indulgence issued by Pope Sixtus in support of the  
war against the Turks. He got a fair amount of business  
from printing indulgences which, somewhat surprisingly,  
claimed to give Catholics relief from Hell or Purgatory in  
exchange for cash. This may help to explain why he started  
his business on Thorney Island where the potential market  
included monks used to producing religious scrolls, lawyers,  
royalty and aristocrats rather than traders in the City of  
London two miles away.

In March 1867, the British North America Act received

Seymour was arrested in 1551 and though acquitted of  
high treason was found guilty of felony for unlawfully  
assembling men in an attempt to incite insurrection which  
carried the death penalty. He was executed on 22nd  
January 1552\.  
The second attempt was strange in a different way. In  
1840, a committee of the House of Commons criticised  
St Margaret’s style of architecture on the grounds that it  
did not suit the Gothic nature of the Abbey. This was at a  
time when Gothic was all the rage as exemplified by the  
reconstruction of the Houses of Parliament after the1834  
fire in Gothic revival style. The MPs recommended  
unanimously that Saint Margaret’s be dismantled stone by  
stone to be erected elsewhere. This plan was mercifully  
rejected, but the odd thing is why it was suggested in the  
first place given that since 1614, Saint Margaret’s had  
been the official parish church of The House of Commons  
which was just across the road.

time, but which later became Mayfair and Belgravia. The  
land has been in the Grosvenor family ever since and  
could have made her, after adjusting for inflation over the  
years, Thorney Island’s first billionaire.  
St Margaret’s, which is very much a working church, has  
had its fair share of fashionable marriages, including  
those of Samuel Pepys and John Milton in the 17th century  
and Winston Churchill and Harold Macmillan in the  
20th. Pepys has left a record of one of his visits which is  
reproduced in the souvenir guide to the church. On 26th  
May 1667, he records that he “did entertain myself with  
my perspective glass (used to magnify images) up and  
down the church, by which I had the great pleasure of  
seeing and gazing at a great many fine women: and what  
with that and sleeping, I passed away the time till the  
sermon was done”. It looks as though for Pepys this acted  
as the equivalent of a modern dating app.  
One of the unforgettable things about St Margaret’s is  
its stained glass. You won’t get a more dramatic contrast  
than between John Piper’s softly toned modernist windows  
along the right hand side as you go in and the amazing  
east window, which is a history lesson in itself.  
This magnificent window with its sky blue background  
was finished around 1526 at Gouda in Holland and  
intended as a gift from the magistrates of Dort to Henry  
Vlll to honour his marriage to Catherine of Aragon,  
both of whom are featured on the left and right at the  
bottom of the window which highlights the crucifixion of  
said to have been first performed. Its Cook’s Tour continued  
when Conyer’s son sold it in 1758 to the parishioners of St  
Margaret’s for 400 guineas.  
Then it starts getting complicated. The Dean and Chapter  
of Westminster regarded it as Popish imagery and started

Land in the hands of Crusaders for another century.  
This made him a hero among Christians during a  
strongly religious age, but a modern more secular  
approach balances his undoubted victories abroad  
with his neglect of governance at home, not least the  
persecution of the Jews, that occurred during his reign.  
The strangest, almost unbelievable, part of his reign  
was in 1192 when he was captured on his return from  
the Third Crusade. His ship was forced to stop near  
money has been estimated by some \- wait for it \- to  
have been an astonishing £2.52 billion, equivalent  
to approaching three times the entire annual income  
of the Crown, a mind-boggling demand which it is  
difficult to believe. Richard was held in custody for 14  
months until the ransom was paid. He was released  
on February, 1194,  
The money was raised through selling assets including  
church property plus higher taxes on clergy and laity  
led by his mother, Eleanor of Aquitaine. The Crown  
also imposed special taxes and sold official positions  
and rights to lands and privileges.  
The population of England during the time of Richard  
the Lionheart, around the late 12th century, is  
estimated to have been between 1.5 and 2 million  
people. If it was two million the cost of the ransom  
would have been £1,260 on average for each  
person, an unbelievable amount, even though the rich  
would have been paying much more. It nevertheless  
placed an enormous burden on poor people who  
often only earned a few pence a day if that. It left a  
lasting antagonism towards increased taxation which  
affected England right up to the Peasants Revolt of  
1381\.  
Richard died in 1199, killed by an arrow fired by  
a former friend Bertram de Gurdun, also known as  
Pierre Basile, who wrongly claimed Richard had killed  
his father and brothers. Whether for this reason or  
There has been no King of England like Richard the  
Lionheart \- or Cœur de Lion \- and there never will be  
again. He was born and lived for only a short time in  
England. He was brought up in Aquitaine where he  
mainly spoke French and Occitan, the old Provencal  
language favoured by the troubadours. There is some  
doubt whether he spoke English at all. His statue is  
now resident in Old Palace Yard (above) on Thorney  
Island as a symbol of all things heroic and English  
though the truth is more complicated.  
Richard the Lionheart is the only king not to have a  
number after his name in popular usage. In fact he  
was Richard l, a leading light during the Crusades.  
He is reckoned to have spent barely six months in  
England during his entire reign from 1189 until his  
death in 1199\.  
He gained a lasting reputation in England because  
of his success during the Crusades. He won several  
victories against his Muslim counterpart Saladin and

and a bad governor”.  
The statue eventually found its way to Old Palace Yard  
after £640,000 (in today’s money) had been raised  
by private donations and other locations such as  
Buckingham Palace, Hyde Park and Marble Arch had  
been rejected. The Lionheart still stands proud in Old

original, has sprung up a few hundred yards away  
in Orchard Place off Victoria Street. Created by the  
sculptor Nick Hornby, it depicts Richard as a romantic  
warrior on one side but as you walk around it mutates  
into what looks like a war machine, enabling viewers  
to read what they like into the reputation of this  
enigmatic monarch.

because its tail fell off the day after it was installed.  
Queen Victoria and Prince Albert headed a list of

with respect to art than  
anything we have done  
for centuries”. The Art  
Journal, however, argued  
that the statue was merely  
a novelty and, worse, The medieval garden  
Richard the Lionheart with 55 Broadway in the background  
Most people walking along Abingdon Street towards  
Millbank \- opposite the Houses of Parliament \- have no  
idea that the wall on the right which continues around  
the corner into Great College Street (where the remains  
of the Tyburn River may still flow underneath) is the  
actual medieval wall that guarded the monastery. It  
also hides one of the hidden gems of London.  
If you are outside it is difficult to believe that on  
the other side of the wall is the oldest continuously  
cultivated garden in the country reaching back at least  
to 1297: yet once inside it is so serenely calm that it  
is difficult to believe that the rest of the world carries  
on outside. According to Jan Pancheri, who recently  
retired as head gardener \- and has written a book The  
Gardens of Westminster Abbey \- it has a microclimate  
that is two degrees higher than outside.  
Asked what makes the garden unique, Jan says:  
“There’s a real sense of the sacred, with a great feeling  
of quietness and respect. It’s an open contemplative  
space where you can have your own thoughts.” She  
adds that they have arranged plants that the monks  
would have used such as wildflowers, aromatic plants,  
120 121and vegetables like cabbages and onions to make the  
place pleasant.  
Sitting in the garden behind the walls you don’t see  
the bustle of London, just the legacy of history; the  
Chapter House, the towers of the Abbey and the  
upper reaches of the buildings of Parliament.  
Wandering around the lawn, it is easy to imagine  
what it once contained. There was an orchard, a  
dovecote, a cider mill, (plus a still for distilling waters  
from herbs) two ponds, fruit and vegetables and even  
a tiny vineyard plus a herbarium which the Abbey has  
records of going back to 1297\. The main reason for  
the garden’s creation was for the College’s infirmerer  
to provide medicinal herbs for the monks and there  
is still a herbarium on roughly the same site. There  
used to be a channel nearby leading from the monks’  
“reredorter” to a mill at the southern edge of the  
garden by the Thames, from which the word Millbank  
is derived. In case you are wondering about the word  
“reredorter” it comes from the Anglo-French words  
“rere” meaning “behind” and “dorter” meaning  
dormitory. Geddit? OK, let’s stick to “necessarium” in  
Latin or just latrines in plain English.  
The dimensions of the garden are unchanged from  
medieval times except that King Edward lll (1312-  
1377\) seized part of the north eastern end to provide  
more room for his palace and the Jewel Tower he was  
building.  
If you were to dig in the garden you would soon be  
unearthing the deposits which formed Thorney Island.  
Today’s garden has a fig tree, plane trees that were  
planted in 1850 and two handsome mulberry trees  
(one black, one white) at each end of the garden.  
Either side of the stone gateway leading to Little  
Dean’s Yard (part of Westminster School) there were,  
until recent years, two stone angels, reputably made  
by Grinling Gibbons and Arnold Quellin, which once  
graced a Chapel at the other end of Whitehall Palace  
where the Ministry of Defence building now is. Even  
in their worn condition they were a magical presence.  
Hopefully, they have been taken away temporarily for  
restoration.

122 12341: The astonishing Duchess of Newcastle  
Margaret Cavendish has been rightly described  
by Professor Peter Sherlock as “one of the most  
astonishing women of the 17th century”. At the time  
she was dismissed as eccentric and nick-named “Mad  
Madge”, but in recent years her contributions to  
science, poetry, plays, essays and feminism are seen  
to have been way ahead of their time despite her lack  
of formal schooling.  
Her eccentricities included requiring her footman  
to sleep in a closet in her bedroom so he could be  
summoned to write down any thoughts she had during  
the night.  
And she certainly had a lot of thoughts. She eventually  
produced ten volumes of what have been described  
as “learned trifles and fantastic verses” many of which  
were so short they may have come straight from her  
footman’s notes, but which are now being examined  
by academics for signs of deep insights.  
She often sent copies of her work to distinguished  
people, sometimes receiving extravagant praise from  
the recipients, possibly with their tongues in their  
cheeks.  
The Duchess undoubtedly suffered from being a  
woman at a time when the scientific establishment

124 125After returning to London from exile in Paris with  
her husband following the Restoration, the Duchess  
became a prolific author. She produced ten volumes  
of what have been described as “learned trifles and

might have come straight from her footman’s notes.  
She also wrote plays, one of which, The Humourous  
Lovers, was described by Samuel Pepys in 1667 as  
“the most silly thing that ever came upon a stage”.  
But what was thought silly then is looked at differently  
today. Cavendish was an early feminist whose poems,  
plays and literary critiques are nowadays pored over  
for signs of deep insights. Her observations about  
natural science are today highly thought of.  
Her book, The Blazing World, is thought to be the first  
work of science fiction by a woman and a pioneer of  
the genre itself.  
During the English Civil War (1642-1651), the  
Royalist Duke and Duchess of Newcastle fled from the  
wrath of Oliver Cromwell, first to Paris and then, for  
12 years, to Antwerp where they rented the house of  
Rubens from his widow.The Duchess published several  
works during their sojourn in Antwerp including:  
Natures Pictures (1656), Sociable Letters (1664), and  
The World’s Olio which contains references to local  
Antwerp life.  
Throughout her time in Antwerp, Margaret Cavendish  
appears to have used the Rubens House as a base for  
her literary, social, and cultural activities, engaging  
with local people and English exiles while developing  
her skills as a writer and patron of the arts.  
A long article in the Stanford Encyclopedia  
of Philosophy admits that though Cavendish’s  
philosophical work was not taken seriously in the 17th  
Rubens’ house in Antwerp  
century “it is certainly relevant today”. The Duchess,  
it claims, laid out “an early and very compelling  
version of the naturalism that is found in current-day  
philosophy and science”. Among numerous other

126 12742: In memory of Philip Clark, plumber  
Westminster Abbey is celebrated for the great and  
the good who are buried or memorialised there from  
kings and queens of England to the great physicists  
Isaac Newton and Stephen Hawking. So it is as  
welcome as it is surprising to find that over 300 years  
ago, an ordinary plumber, Philip Clark, was buried  
there \- and not as one name on a long list, but with a  
large tombstone of his own. It was one of the largest  
in the main cloister and set in white rather than the  
usual black marble. Very little is known about him. He  
was much too early to have been involved with the  
more famous, but unmemorialised, plumber, Thomas  
Crapper (1836 \- 1910), a surprising amount of whose  
work can be seen around the Abbey.  
Christine Reynolds, assistant keeper of the Muniments  
at the Abbey, says: “It was usual for Abbey workmen  
to be buried in the cloisters at this period, and have  
the normal size of gravestone for the time. The stone  
must have been re-cut at some time to be still clear  
enough to read”.  
Clark was not married, apparently, and left his estate  
to Frances Warren, his sister’s child, having worked  
at the Abbey doing lead and pipe work around the  
Abbey and at Westminster School for 43 years until  
his death in 1707\. As a plumber, Clark would almost  
certainly have been involved in the maintenance of  
the conduit the monks built to take water from the  
Tyburn river.  
An American plumber, whose mother was called  
Clark, was bowled over on seeing, during a recent  
visit, that one of his profession was honoured over  
300 years ago in one of the most famous churches in  
the world. He went away hoping to find that he was  
related to him.  
Although the burial of workmen in the Abbey appears  
to have been not uncommon in those days, it is excellent  
that the Abbey has preserved this tombstone as a fitting  
memory of ordinary folk. It doesn’t compare with the  
tomb of the unknown warrior. Its real significance is  
as a reminder of the thousands of workmen who toiled  
anonymously to help make the Abbey what it is today.  
43: Ministering to the necessities of life  
This corner of the Abbey’s Little Cloister is hardly  
noticed by any of the large numbers of visitors to the  
Abbey, and is a bit of a puzzle even if you do notice  
it. The tiles at the top suggest that whatever it was must  
have been quite tall. In fact it is almost all that remains  
of a vital bit of 11th century engineering, built at the  
time of Edward the Confessor, that changed the life of  
the monks at Westminster.  
It goes back to St Benedict (AD 480- AD 547), the  
founder of the Benedictine order. He laid down that  
the period after morning matins was reserved for the  
“necessities” of life. The place where the necessities  
of life were performed was usually located behind the  
dorter (Latin for dormitory). It became known as using  
the reredorter (“rere” is French for “behind”), one of  
the more obscure euphemisms of its kind.  
The fact remains that for all their otherworldliness, the  
monks needed to come down to earth and spend a  
penny before washing themselves. Hence this two-  
storey structure which supplied water from a conduit  
built in Hyde Park travelling along sunken wooden  
pipes \- some of which are still there \- under St James’s  
Park and Strutton Ground, and then between the  
kitcheners’ garden and the Almonry at the entrance  
to the Abbey (where money was distributed to the  
poor) and into the monastery itself. It flowed through  
the reredorter by the side of the Little Cloister before  
exiting into the Thames through a drain, the remains  
of which can still be seen by the Jewel Tower. If you  
had walked in the other direction \- i.e. through the  
blocked wall in the photo \- you would have come to  
Little Dean’s Yard and the ancient Ashburnham House,  
both of which have remnants of the reredorter, but are  
now part of Westminster School.  
The intriguing reredorter  
The reredorter was 96 feet long by 30 feet wide. It  
consisted of two storeys with the latrines situated on  
the upper level. The photo shows barely half of the  
height of it. There was a deep drop into stone lined  
sewers below so that… let’s not go there.  
The reredorter meant that the monks had access to  
fresh, or freshish, water that was not available to the  
general population. However, the Grand Conduit in  
New Palace Yard, which lasted from the 15th to the  
17th century, was a secular fountain open to local  
inhabitants for their water supplies.  
128 12944: A journey into virtual reality  
45: Uncovering the Grand Sacristy among  
the sands of Thorney Island  
Westminster Abbey is a mesmerising medieval  
church, yet it can also be viewed as a museum of  
sculptures with a unique church attached. There are  
around 600 monumental sculptures which the huge  
number of visitors who pass by can only partially  
absorb.  
The most eye-catching sculptor has to be Louis  
François Roubiliac (1702-62), a brilliant Frenchman  
who moved to London to find fame, fortune and,  
like so many creatives of the era, eventual poverty.  
His most dramatic work \- an 18th century foray into  
virtual reality \- depicts Lady Elizabeth Nightingale,  
who died in pregnancy, with her husband forlornly  
trying to fend off the skeletal figure of Death which  
has risen from the depths of the underworld, deathly  
spear in hand. In real life, she was killed by a bolt  
of lightning which not even a great sculptor like  
Roubiliac could reproduce in stone.  
It was an attempt to rewind history so that Elizabeth’s  
husband Joseph Gascoigne could be seen vainly  
to be trying to prevent Death from taking his wife.  
The sculpture was carved of white Carrara marble  
from north Tuscany that has been used for a huge  
number of monuments, from Michelangelo’s David  
to the Marble Arch in London. The Carrara quarries  
are said to have produced more marble than any  
other place on earth.  
Washington Irving, the American author of Rip Van Winkle  
(actually written while he was in Birmingham, England) said  
it was ‘among the most renowned achievements of modern  
art’. John Wesley, one of the founders of Methodism,  
observed that it was one of the finest monuments in the  
Abbey, because “the marble seems to speak”.  
Maybe it was the marble’s supposed speech that was  
behind the story of a robber who broke into the church, but  
was so frightened by the shadowy figure of Death that he  
fled in terror.  
The original sand of Thorney Island in the Grand Sacristy  
One of the fascinating things about Westminster  
Abbey is that fresh bits of its buried history are still  
being uncovered by archaeologists. One of the latest  
is Henry lll’s Great Sacristy between the Abbey and St  
Margaret’s churchyard which, when it is reconstructed,  
will be a new welcoming place for visitors to the  
Abbey built on some of its medieval remains. It has  
been renamed the King Charles lll Sacristy.  
130 131The excavations were started by Sir Gilbert Scott  
way back in 1869, when the ground level had to be  
reduced by up to three feet to remove the centuries of  
accumulation.  
In the cloister area near the Sacristy, a large Roman  
sarcophagus with a lid dating back to the 4th century  
was found. It can now be seen in the Triforium museum,  
upstairs in the Abbey.  
In 2009, the Abbey invited Channel 4’s Time Team  
to conduct an exploratory excavation. This confirmed  
that the foundations of the L shape building were  
intact along with other well-preserved archaeological  
deposits. Recent excavations by Pre-Construct  
Archaeology have unearthed more remains of the  
sacristy built in the 1250s by Henry III, at his own  
expense. This was part of his complete reconstruction  
of Edward the Confessor’s 11th-century church  
remnants of which were found, including dozens of  
bodies, presumed to be mainly monks.  
During the excavations a “stacked grave” was  
uncovered which at first was thought to have  
belonged to the “regicides” who participated in the  
execution of Charles I. However, later analysis of the  
dates showed this was not possible, though some of  
the regicides were buried nearby in the churchyard  
of St Margaret’s. They had been exhumed from their  
original burial places in the Abbey on the orders of  
Charles ll to avenge the death of his father, Charles l.  
More intriguingly, at least for me, was something  
else. While archaeologists were digging underneath  
the surface they found what an official guide told  
us during a visit was “the original sand of Thorney  
Island” (pictured above). It was typical of the sand  
and gravel that enabled the formation of what became  
Thorney Island, one of the few islands or eyots in  
the Thames floodplain, to be formed higher than the  
surrounding marshland. This made it habitable for the  
original monastery and Abbey and with less flooding  
risk. Without this gift of nature there would have been  
no Abbey or Royal Palace in that place, let alone a  
Thorney Island.  
46: Where Henry Purcell and Robert  
Herrick plied their trade  
St Ann’s Lane with Purcell’s house on the right drawn on April 15, 1845 by R W Withal  
St Ann’s Lane always was, and still is, a short narrow  
thoroughfare leading from Old Pye Street to Great  
Peter Street in Westminster. It achieved notoriety in  
the 19th century when, along with Old Pye Street, it  
was the epi-centre of degradation and criminality that  
Charles Dickens popularised as “The Devil’s Acre”.  
Much less well known is that in the late 17th century  
it had seen better days. It was the home of two giants  
of English culture. On 10th September 1659, Henry  
Purcell, one of the greatest of all English composers,  
was born in St Ann’s Lane in the house pictured  
above. It is where St Andrew’s youth club, claimed  
to be the oldest in the world, is located today. One of  
the existing residents was the poet Robert Herrick and  
they must have overlapped for a while. Herrick’s most  
remembered words are::  
“Gather ye rose-buds while ye may,  
Old Time is still a-flying;  
And this same flower that smiles today  
Tomorrow will be dying.”  
132 133This was but one of 2,500 poems he wrote, half of  
which were released in a single major collection,  
Hesperides, published in 1648, on his return to  
his native London from Devon. Herrick apparently  
expected the book to be read in its entirety in the  
order in which it was printed.  
Herrick and Purcell were there at the same time for  
barely three years, but Herrick must have been aware  
of a newborn baby in such a tiny street, not least  
because he was a clergyman. He had been forced  
to leave his parish at Dean Prior in Devon when the  
Puritans took over during the English civil war to return  
to his beloved London for 13 years.  
a source of degradation and  
iniquity.  
Had they been true  
contemporaries, they would  
have had plenty to talk  
about as dozens of Herrick’s  
poems were set to music in  
the 17th century, not least by  
William and Henry Lawes  
who apparently performed  
their version of Herrick’s  
What Sweeter Music before  
King Charles I at Whitehall.  
It includes the lines  
“Dark and dull night, fly  
hence away,  
And give the honour to this  
day,  
That sees December turned  
to May”.  
Neither Purcell nor Herrick  
are household names today,  
but both are still remembered

134 13547: They died in poverty  
Oh, rare Ben Jonson,  
As should be known  
by every London cabbie,  
He’s buried standing up  
in Westminster Abbey.  
(VK)  
It is very sad to look at the roll call of some of Britain’s  
most revered poets buried at Poet’s Corner and to be  
reminded how many died in poverty. The saddest of  
all was Ben Jonson, who in his latter years lived in a  
house in the Abbey grounds close to St Margaret’s  
Church, but who, despite a glittering career writing  
plays and masques for royalty as well as the ordinary  
folk of London, died in what was called “Greek  
Poverty” or utter penury.  
A proper grave was beyond his means and he ended  
up being buried, at his own request, standing up. It  
is the only instance of a vertical burial in the Abbey  
taking up a minimal amount of the Abbey’s precious  
space. He may have been a bit ahead of his time as  
the problem of London running out of burial space  
could have been solved if all tombs were vertical  
rather than horizontal.  
The tile that marks his grave can be seen on the left  
after entering the western entrance to the Abbey near  
a plaque on the wall with the famous words “O rare  
Ben Johnson” (the original spelling). Whether he or  
someone else wrote the words and whether there  
should be no space between the first two letters (which  
would turn it into the Latin ‘orare’ meaning to pray), a  
possible allusion to Jonson’s Catholic leanings, is still  
a matter for discussion. The words were apparently  
suggested by a passer by who paid a workman to  
carve the epithet.  
Ben Jonson  
Edmund Spenser  
The next day the chasm between poverty and  
fame was closed when Jonson was interned after a  
procession attended according to a contemporary by  
“all or the greatest part of the nobility and gentry then  
in the town”.  
This same bizarre ritual attended the funerals of  
Edmund Spenser (or Spencer), author of The Faerie  
Queen, and Michael Drayton, a major poet and  
playwright. Both died in poverty only to be given what  
seemed like State funerals.  
Spenser, according to his friend William Drummond  
of Hawthornden, died in real poverty “for the lack  
of bread“ in King Street Westminster, yet soon after  
he died, aristocrats and poets alike came to shower  
laurels on his grave. His coffin was carried in state from  
his last home in King Street across today’s Parliament  
Square to the Abbey paid for by the Earl of Essex.  
Then, according to William Camden, the historian,  
something happened that still resonates today. His  
hearse “was attended by poets and mournful elegies,  
and poems with the pens that wrote them were  
thrown into his tomb”. Scholars still wonder whether  
Shakespeare was among the mourners and, if he was,  
could something he wrote still be there?  
Michael Drayton, who is all but forgotten nowadays  
but was a rival to Shakespeare in his time, died in  
poverty on 23rd December 1631 at his lodgings in  
Fleet Street close by St Dunstan’s church. Yet he was so  
highly regarded by his contemporaries that, according  
to the antiquary William Fulman: “The Gentlemen of  
the Four Innes of Court and others of note about the  
Town, attended his body to Westminster.”  
136 13748: Merrie England arises in slum-torn  
Westminster  
The area in front of City Hall  
in Victoria Street, now the  
site of an enormous office  
block, used to be one of the  
wonders of old Westminster. It  
was here in 1654 that a local  
philanthropist did something  
special. He built Palmer’s  
Village, a romanticised  
memory of Merrie England  
complete with a village  
green, a pub, a blacksmith  
and even a maypole.  
It was on the site (in yellow)  
where the Army and Navy  
Stores started life in 1871  
as a cooperative selling a  
variety of goods to officers  
and others in the army.  
It was much loved by its  
Six almshouses above Palmer’s Village (Horwood’s Plan). The Devil’s Acre is in red on the right (1792-79)

Michael Drayton  
the characters in Agatha Christie novels. Many of  
ancient Bridewell Prison (where the Greencoat Boy  
its goods were manufactured in local factories and  
Geoffrey Chaucer, the first resident of Poets’ Corner,  
may have avoided penury on his death but if so it was  
only just. In 1398, he was forced to borrow against  
his annuity and was sued for debt. However, in 1399,  
shortly before his death, Chaucer was granted an  
annual pension by King Henry IV, which would have  
secured his financial stability.  
Wenceslaus Hollar (1607-1677) was not a poet but  
his amazing engravings of London leave us all in his  
debt, making him a match for the poets in terms of  
creativity. Like them he also died in abject poverty  
on Thorney Island in Gardener’s Lane. His portfolio  
of engravings in England and Europe, many of  
them executed when he was a favourite of his long-  
term employer Lord Arundel, were an astonishing  
achievement, yet didn’t prevent an ignominious death  
when he had to plead with the bailiffs in his room as  
a favour not to take his bed away before he died. He  
was buried in St Margaret’s churchyard.

It was called Palmer’s Village after the Rev. James  
was almost certainly pickpocketed by Charles Dickens  
Palmer who, along with other philanthropists attached  
as the model for the fictional Fagin’s Den in Oliver  
to Thorney Island, built much needed almshouses and  
Twist. Palmer’s Village was built extremely close to the  
schools creating an impact which is still felt today. The138 139map at the top of this article shows that six almshouses  
were built close to each other by philanthropists  
whose memories have been retained by the names of  
the roads.  
The pioneer was Cornelius Van Dun (1483–1577), a  
Flemish soldier who, amazingly, served four monarchs  
(Henry Vlll, Edward, Mary and Elizabeth), quite a  
feat in those days, and died at the astonishing age  
of 94\. Starting in 1569, he built 20 houses for poor  
widows at his own expense in Petty France, where  
Vandon Street is today and nearby St Ermin’s Hill. The  
epitaph on his grave is the oldest in St Margaret’s  
church.  
Palmer built his village in order to provide long-term  
financial support for the almshouses he had constructed  
across the road in Palmer Street where the Albert pub  
is today.  
Palmer’s initiative was, astonishingly, one of six  
almshouses within hugging distance of each other.  
They were built by benefactors whose good works are  
remembered 350 years later today in nearby streets  
including Emery Hill Street, Vandon Street (named after  
van Dunn), Dacre Street and Palmer Street. Nicholas  
Butler also had a street named after him off Palmer  
Street near where his two almshouses were located.  
Lady Dacre built the almshouses known as Emanuel  
Hospital in 1600 on the site of today’s prestigious  
Taj Hotel in Buckingham Gate. Westminster City,  
a comprehensive school which backs on to the end  
of the Taj hotels, can trace its ancestry back to Lady  
Dacre’s almshouses on the same piece of land.  
Cornelius van Dunn, pioneer of Westminster almshouses (from St  
Margaret’s Church)  
The Rev. Palmer (1595-1659) had Thorney Island  
written all over him. He was born in 1585 and was  
baptised and buried in St Margaret’s Church. He  
spent much of his priesthood at St Brides in Fleet  
Street where he could often be found sleeping in the  
steeple to save money. He gave regular sermons at St  
Margaret’s including to both houses of Parliament. He  
is remembered by plaques in the church and also high  
up in Rochester Row by the junction with Emery Hill  
Street, though you will have to strain your eyes to find  
it let alone read it.  
By 1834, the Bridewell prison had been replaced by  
an enormous new penitentiary, the Tothill Fields prison  
which stretched from today’s Francis Street to Victoria  
James Palmer in St Margaret’s church  
Street, on the land where Westminster Cathedral is  
today. It would have completely dominated the view  
from Palmer’s village. The foundations of the prison  
were so strong they were retained. The Cathedral  
rests on the base of the former prison.  
The 1841 census gives us an idea of the sorts of  
people who were living in Palmer’s village. There were  
labourers, servants, brassworkers, a scavenger, a hat  
trimmer, a stonemason, a laundress, a stableman, a  
plasterer, a soldier and so on, a plausible cross section  
of Merrie England.  
In 1853, Charles Manby Smith wrote a wonderful  
description of it called “A Deserted Village in London”  
known as Palmer’s Village. He tells us that he had lived140 141in the village during many happy  
years of his youth, some twenty or  
thirty years earlier. He deplored  
the way that the village had been  
swallowed up by the expansion  
of London and then disappeared  
altogether when Victoria Street  
was constructed through it between  
1845 and 1851\.  
Smith wrote of “the great Babylon,  
where, though hemmed in all around  
by crowded streets, dark narrow  
lanes and fetid courts, it (Palmer’s  
Village) yet retained many of the  
rural charms of its primal condition.  
It had yet a village green…and  
on the green, every first of May,  
up rose, reared by invisible hands  
in the night, the village May-pole,  
round which we have seen the lads  
and lasses dancing to the music of their own laughter.”  
He added: “It had an old-fashioned way-side inn,  
the Prince of Orange; well we remember it, and its  
merry-faced and active little landlord, Wiggins, who  
never would be still, and never could be sad, but  
with a perennial laugh on his lips and a joke on his  
tongue, welcomed the weary traveller to cheap and  
wholesome refreshment. Then there was Mrs. Wiggins  
who lived in the bar, and of whom nobody ever saw  
more than the head and shoulders”.  
It is not clear where Palmer got all his money from. It was  
presumably inherited, but it is an excellent example of  
the long term effects of philanthropy. Palmer’s original  
alms house, which merged with several others in 1879  
to become the United Westminster Almshouses, is still  
functioning in Rochester Row, providing sheltered  
accommodation for 41 men and women over 60 years  
49: Thorney Island’s influence on the NHS  
of age of limited means who have local credentials.  
The school he founded, known as the Black Coat  
school \- to distinguish it from the Greycoat, Greencoat  
and Blue Coat schools \- eventually joined with others  
to become today’s Westminster City comprehensive in  
Palace Street.  
Palmer’s Village lasted until Victoria Street blasted  
its way through the slums in the mid 19th century.  
On 27th February 1851, the houses were disposed  
of by auction as part of the so-called Westminster  
Improvements to make room for the construction of  
Victoria Street. At the time of writing yet another multi  
storey, multi purpose edifice is being built on the site  
of Palmer’s Village of a size that could not have been  
conceived when children were dancing around the  
maypole in that oasis of Merrie England. I hope the  
Reverend Palmer is sleeping peacefully.  
For over 100 years, Thorney Island had its own  
hospital. It was where the Queen Elizabeth ll conference  
centre is today, facing Westminster Abbey. It was no  
ordinary hospital. In its time it helped to change the  
concept of what hospitals were all about. In medieval  
times, London had had only two big hospitals, Barts  
and St Thomas’s, but they were not really hospitals  
in the modern sense as their job, believe it or not,  
wasn’t primarily to cure the sick. And for over 400  
years there were no new ones.  
Medieval hospitals were hostels for beggars, not  
somewhere you went to be cured. As Rotha Mary  
Clay (1878 \-1961), a historian and social worker  
pointed out the hospital then was “an ecclesiastical,  
not a medical institution. It was for care rather than  
cure; for the relief of the body when possible, but pre-  
eminently for the refreshment of the soul”.  
This started to change on 14th January 1716 when  
rich banker, Henry Hoare, stepped out of the family  
firm C Hoare and Co in Fleet Street, to St Dunstan’s  
coffee house next door to meet three friends, William  
Wogan, Robert Witham and a former curate of St  
Dunstan’s church (across the road from Hoare’s bank)  
Patrick Cockburn. They met to discuss a problem  
no-one else was dealing with: what to do about the  
scandalous lack of help for the poor sick people of  
Westminster. Henry volunteered the first donation of  
£10 for what was to become London’s first subscription  
hospital.  
From this unlikely beginning can be traced the birth  
of Westminster Hospital and later St George’s. (Guys  
came shortly after) Such was the magnitude of the task  
that it didn’t happen instantly. In April of the first year  
they decided to restrict their efforts to the parish of  
142 143St Margaret’s, Westminster, “until it shall please God  
that our stock increases”. They presumably chose St  
Margaret’s parish because it was right in the centre  
of governance serving a growing population of the  
rich and powerful, but also characterised by extreme  
poverty and poor living conditions coupled with a  
paucity of any medical help for the poor.  
It was linked to Anglicanism because of Westminster  
Abbey and St Margaret’s church which was almost in  
the Abbey’s back garden. They didn’t know that the  
large hospital they would eventually build would be  
just across the road from the Abbey.  
There followed an unexplained hiatus in their initial  
activities until December 1718 when a couple of  
meetings were held including one at Grey Coats  
school \- still on the same site in Greycoat Place today  
as it was then \- when a matron Mrs Jane Alden was  
appointed at £6 a year.  
In 1719, Sir Henry and his founders rented a house  
in Petty France (then called York Street) to house an  
infirmary for the needy and in 1720 it opened with  
only 10 beds, later increased to 20\. It was situated  
across the road from today’s Adam and Eve pub at  
the end of Palmer Street (then called Gardners Lane).  
It was next door to what later became the site of an  
international ice rink which staged the World Figure  
Skating Championships in 1902\.  
The hospital moved to Chappell Street in 1724 (later  
renamed Broadway). However, in 1733 there was  
a serious argument between the Governors and the  
medical staff as a result of which there was a mass  
exodus of the medics who migrated to a new site  
at Hyde Park Corner to found St George’s Hospital  
leaving the governors of the infirmary to pick up the  
pieces. Which they did by moving to Buckingham  
Gate (soon to have 91 beds) to be known as the  
Westminster Infirmary for the Sick. In one sense this  
was a disaster, but it did lead to another hospital  
being formed, so Westminster got two hospitals for  
the price of one.  
Henry Hoare  
In 1834, a new site opposite Westminster Abbey was  
(now a block of luxury flats) where it lasted until 1993  
purchased from the Treasury which enabled a much  
when it moved to Fulham Road to become part of the  
bigger hospital to be built in what has been described  
Westminster and Chelsea hospital. It may be difficult  
as “embattled Gothic” style accommodating 200 in-  
for us to believe that hospitals could have existed for  
patients or up to 20,000 a year in all. Patients were  
over 400 years without having the aim of curing the

sick. The new hospital made mistakes on the way \- for

51: Where is Henry VIII?  
No king had more effect on Thorney Island and its  
surroundings than Henry VIII. When the fire of 1512  
badly damaged the medieval Palace of Westminster,  
which had lasted for 500 years, instead of rebuilding  
it, Henry pulled it down. He transported the stone  
\- in thousands of cartloads \- to help build a new  
vastly bigger palace occupying most of what we  
call Whitehall today. He subsequently appropriated  
St James’s Park, The Green Park \- both of which he  
put a wall around \- Hyde Park and today’s Regent’s  
Park, to create his own private hunting grounds. This  
was in addition to over 50 palaces and houses he  
owned or acquired up and down the country, not to  
mention unleashing the Reformation which changed  
Westminster Abbey and religion forever and triggered  
an economic revolution as huge tracts of monastic  
lands came onto the market.  
A man of such doomsday grandeur would obviously  
need a tomb to remind posterity of his magnificence  
and to ensure the longevity of the Tudor dynasty. This  
Henry planned to do on an epic scale and he started  
at a very early stage in his rule. The main documented  
evidence of his plans date back to 1518 but he  
appears to have started planning for a tomb soon  
after he was crowned in 1509\.  
No expense was spared and If things had gone  
according to plan, Henry would have had a tomb  
like no other. He appropriated Cardinal Wolsey’s  
partially built tomb including its marble base, statues  
and pillars and planned to add to this some gilded  
bronze angels, no less than four life sized statues of  
the King and his favourite subsequent Queen (Jane  
Seymour). And if that wasn’t enough there would be  
a statue of the King on horseback under a triumphal  
These are three metre tall Angels commissioned by Cardinal Wolsey for  
his tomb (Now in the Victoria and Albert museum).  
146 147arch, plus 134 brass figures ranging from John the  
Baptist to St George.  
It was self-aggrandisement on a gargantuan scale,  
projecting an image of unbridled medieval masculinity  
that bore no relation to the modest successes he made  
during his brief but expensive invasion of France in  
1513\.

On 4th July 1862, a don at Christchurch College  
Oxford, Charles Dodgson, took three sisters on a  
boating trip along the river Isis together with his friend,  
the sub-dean of Westminster Abbey, Rev Robinson  
Duckworth. When they stopped for tea on a shady  
bank, one of the sisters, as she later recalled, implored  
Dodgson to “tell us a story”.  
The sister was called Alice and she was enthralled  
by the tales that emerged about a girl, also called  
Alice, who followed a white rabbit with a waistcoat  
down a hole into a mystical wonder world. She  
begged Dodgson, a mathematician at Christchurch,  
to write them down. The mathematician, later known  
as Lewis Carroll, did as he was told (the girl was quite  
forceful and very curious, even at the age of ten).  
When Dodgson finished the book he gave her the  
manuscript. It eventually became Alice’s Adventures  
in Wonderland and its successor, Through the Looking  
Glass, which have sold over 100 million copies world-  
wide and been translated into 174 languages. It is  
still selling strongly today. It was the Harry Potter of  
its day.

Alice returned to the Abbey on 15th September 1880,  
aged 28 to get married to Reginald Hargreaves – a  
pupil of Dodgson’s at ChristChurch. She was happy to  
live a private life until 1928, when money problems  
forced her to sell Dodgson’s manuscript to an  
American collector which triggered something like a  
national outcry.  
Twenty years later, the original manuscript was  
returned to the UK, in gratitude for Britain fighting with  
the US in the Second World War. It is now one of the  
treasured possessions of the British Library and can  
be viewed online. Alice wasn’t buried here, but an  
article in the Westminster Abbey Review points out  
that in the quire of the Abbey, Robinson Duckworth,  
sub dean of the Abbey, is buried. He is assured of a  
What is less well-known is a connection between the  
fictional Alice and the real-life Alice \- Alice Liddell \-  
with Thorney Island. She was born in 1852, a year  
after the opening of Victoria Street, the daughter of Rev  
Henry George Liddell, the headmaster of Westminster  
School. She was baptised in the Abbey and lived in  
the house (picture above) in Dean’s Yard Westminster  
for four years before her parents moved up the Thames  
to Oxford when her father was appointed Dean of  
Christchurch. Liddell’s arch is the main entrance to  
Little Dean’s Yard, the centre of the school, and it is  
easy to imagine Alice scampering through the arch in

rowing the boat at the time the tale was told by Lewis  
Carroll and is memorialised in the book, with a riff on  
his name. He is the Duck in the Jury Box and the Duck  
in the Pool of Tears. His grave is marked by a dotted  
line in the Abbey’s Quire near where he used to sit.  
It is unusual to have a dotted line to mark your grave.  
It’s the sort of dotty thing that might have happened in  
Wonderland.  
There is one more link in what might one day become a  
themed Wonderland journey for visitors. Neither Alice  
nor Carroll were buried in the Abbey, but in 1982  
a memorial stone to Carroll was unveiled at Poets  
Corner. Unlike the surrounding stones \- for Byron, D

that of Lewis Carroll is round. Clearly a rabbit hole  
waiting for another iconic visitor.  
150 15153: The man who saved Britain’s early  
history  
From this house sprung the richest private  
collection of books and manuscripts  
ever recorded in the UK. It exceeded the  
collections of the Royal Library, the Inns of  
Court and the College of Arms. They were  
collected by Sir Robert Bruce Cotton MP  
(1571–1631) whose house, the ruins of  
His claim on our gratitude is partly because of the  
priceless manuscripts he rescued from oblivion \- such  
as the Lindisfarne Gospels, the only copy of Beowulf,  
two copies of the original Magna Carta, Sir Gavin  
and the Green Knight and so on.  
It is a sobering thought that without that impulsive  
action we may not have had Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings  
or C S Lewis’ Chronicles of Narnia, both of which  
were inspired by Beowulf. The book continues to be  
influential today. Seamus Heaney, the great Irish poet,  
has been much praised for his translation of Beowulf,  
which was published in 1999 and remains popular  
today.  
We should also be grateful to Cotton because at a time  
when most libraries were private he allowed others to  
use them including scholars, politicians and lawyers. It  
is tempting to think that Shakespeare could have had  
access to them as he would have overlapped with Sir  
Robert in the early part of his life. There is, however,  
no evidence that they knew each other \- though they  
could have.  
Cotton was a friend of Ben Jonson and others who  
were friends of Shakespeare and if Shakespeare  
did know him he would have had potential access  
which along with other debris are shown  
to his library which might help to explain where part  
in this illustration, was situated between the

The Library was eventually given to the nation  
Cotton’s house in a dilapidated state. Drawn by J T Smith  
Whatever else, that collection, according to the  
historian Kevin Sharpe, was “a library of manuscripts,  
by Cotton’s grandson and was the most prestigious  
founding donation to what became the British Library.  
It could so easily not have happened but for Cotton’s  
bull-nosed determination to make sure that vital historic  
documents were preserved for the nation.  
This was a time, after the Dissolution of the Monasteries,  
when government documents and priceless historical  
manuscripts regularly fell into the hands of people  
ignorant of their historic value. History was being  
unwittingly destroyed. There were even examples  
of ordinary folk innocently filling bungholes with  
medieval manuscripts.  
Cotton made it his duty and pleasure to buy and  
preserve them for the nation.possessing a monopoly of the most important material  
for early English history”. An introduction to the Act of  
Parliament establishing trusts for the Cottonian Library  
said it was “generally esteemed the best collection of  
its kind now anywhere extant.”  
Cotton certainly took care of it. He had it organised

(1702-1762), (Source Wikipedia and the British Museum)  
according to the exact position of each book in a room  
152 153that was 26 feet long and six feet wide. For instance  
“Vitellius A.xv” meant under the bust of Vitellius  
on the top shelf (A), count fifteen (xv) across for the  
volume which included the only surviving manuscript  
of Beowulf. The manuscripts are, apparently, still  
catalogued in this way in the British Library.  
The Cotton collection was not only highly valuable  
but because it was also fairly freely available, highly  
controversial. Information, or data, in those days, as  
now, was powerful and the Government didn’t want it  
to get into the wrong hands.  
In 1629, Cotton was arrested for making available a  
pamphlet held to be seditious. As it turned out, it had  
actually been written earlier by someone else.  
He was released, but it didn’t stop the library being  
closed on this pretext. It remained closed until after his  
death and was not restored to his son and heir, Sir  
Thomas Cotton, until 1633\.  
Long after Cotton’s death, Charles l stayed at the  
Alexandrinus which contains most of the Greek Old  
and New Testaments. One of the worst losses was a  
unique manuscript of the Life of King Alfred the Great.  
Sir Robert’s grandson, Sir John Cotton, donated the  
library to Great Britain upon his death in 1702\. In  
1753, the library was transferred to the new British  
Museum, under the Act of Parliament which established  
it. The Act stated that the library was to ‘be kept and  
preserved ... “for Publick Use and Advantage”, and  
that it should “not be sold, or otherwise disposed of”.  
At the same time the Sloane Collection, donated by  
Sir Hans Sloane and the Harley Collection by Edward  
Harley, the Earl of Oxford were acquired. These  
three became the museum’s “foundation collections”.  
The Royal manuscripts were donated by George II  
in 1757 and in 1973 all became part of the newly  
established British Library. The soul of the library is still  
the foundation volumes so many of which were saved  
from oblivion by Sir Robert. It could so easily not have  
been so.

the ceremony.  
They had a child together, Charlotte, and that was the  
end of their relationship though his efforts to divorce  
her were thwarted by Parliament as was his earlier  
attempt in 1785 to illegally marry Mrs Fitzherbert.  
George was determined  
to avoid a scene like this  
happening again at his  
coronation twenty-six years  
later in 1821\. There was  
only one way. He decided  
to ban his wife from  
attending his coronation  
ceremony.  
He insisted that no one  
should be admitted without  
a ticket, and he made sure  
that she wasn’t issued with  
a ticket. This didn’t stop  
Caroline from trying on  
several occasions to gain  
entry, but despite initial  
support from the crowd  
their enthusiasm eventually  
waned.  
George survived the lavish  
banquet in a state that  
was not recorded. The  
problem was how would  
he get home? His normal  
route up Whitehall into the  
Mall and then to Carlton  
House was too crowded with people for the carriages  
to get through. Opinions differ as to whether, as  
some warned, his safety might be at risk because  
of unfriendly crowds or, more likely there were just  
too many onlookers around trying to be part of the  
coronation ceremony.  
Whatever the reason, it was decided that the King had  
to go home by a different route. This meant travelling  
down Abingdon Street and Millbank through Five  
Fields, a circuitous route to the back entrance to

After all that, it is no great surprise that George IV  
was not one of our most successful Kings. He was a  
significant patron of the arts, and he didn’t involve  
the country in any foreign wars, but his continued  
extravagance and loose living made him unpopular  
among taxpayers.

156 15755: THE LETHAL LEGACY OF TOTHILL FIELDS  
Horseferry Road on the way to the Thames. It provides  
a protective ring around the roads of old Westminster  
before the wild west of Tothill Fields begins. The thin  
yellow line on the left of Tothill Fields flanked by tiny  
trees in the map above is Rochester Row, for centuries  
a private lane to the country retreat of the Abbots of  
Westminster Abbey at Neyte in Chelsea.  
The most flamboyant event to be staged on Tothill  
Fields was as far back as 1256, when John Mansell,  
the King’s councillor and also a rich priest, hosted the  
dinner to end all dinners. It was too large to be held  
at his house in Tothill Street so he set up tents and  
pavilions in the wilderness of Tothill Fields. The A-list  
guests included King Richard III and Queen Eleanor  
of Provence, the King and Queen of Scotland and a  
dizzy array of barons and knights.  
The scale of the event is reflected in the fact that  
“seven hundred messes of meat did not serve for the  
first dinner”. It was so big that it was wrongly thought  
to have been a Coronation feast for Richard and  
Eleanor. Mansell is remembered today by Maunsell  
Street off Vincent Square.  
After that it was all ups and downs. There was a bright  
side to Tothill Fields, but also a tragic one. John Strype  
(1643-1737) said that the fields were noted “for  
supplying London and Westminster with asparagus,  
artichokes, cauliflowers and musk melons” but the  
17th century had a darker shadow when Tothill Fields  
John Rocque’s map (c1746) shows (in yellow) the road from Tothill Street to Horseferry Road on the way to the Thames at today’s Lambeth Bridge. The “Toot” or raised look-out mound which gave rise  
to its name is coloured red on the turn of Horseferry Road. Rochester Row is in thin yellow on the left and the notorious “Devil’s Acre”, arguably the most deprived and criminalised area in the whole

Around 960 A.D., Saint Dunstan, who was then  
Bishop of London, established a monastery on the  
site of “ruined chapels” located in the marshland of  
Thorn Ea, at Bulinga Fen. It was the perfect place for a  
contemplative existence, being two miles from the city  
of London and with hardly any habitation in Bulinga  
Fen. The picture (below) by G Arnald was painted  
in 1807\. It shows how little had changed by then,  
barely three years before William Vincent, Dean of  
Westminster, carved out part of Tothill Fields for the  
playing fields of Westminster School in what is now  
known as Vincent Square (though it is actually shaped  
like a diamond not a square).  
With a certain amount of artistic licence \- the area  
was much more built up by 1807 than the painting  
suggests \- it shows a view of the Abbey from Rochester  
Row where the trees can be seen. A horse and cart  
in the middle distance is meandering its way along  
Horseferry Road (formerly Market Street) towards the  
horse ferry by the river. In between is the start of Tothill  
Fields.  
Over the centuries, Tothill Fields has witnessed all  
human life as it evolved from a swampy wasteland  
and the haunt of highwaymen, to a playground for  
school children and an emerging market garden with  
prize asparagus and melons.  
October 1665: “They tell me that in Westminster there  
Tothill Fields was formerly known as Bulinga Fen, a  
Before the 15th century, it was a mustering ground for  
160 161troops who had to be proficient with England’s battle-  
winning adoption of the longbow which helped to  
secure victory at Crecy during the Hundred Years War  
in 1346\. In the 16th and 17th century, wrestling, cock  
fighting and a primitive form of football took over.  
During the 17th century it was the scene of military  
training and the burial of bodies during outbreaks of  
plague.  
J E Smith, the Vestry clerk for the parishes of St  
Margaret, and St John the Evangelist in his book  
“Parochial Memorials”, writes about cock fighting  
and bear baiting including this advertisement from the  
reign of Queen Anne about a famous bear garden in  
Tothill Fields “upon part of the site of Vincent Square”.  
“At William Well’s Bear Garden in Tothill Fields, this  
present Monday, the 10th of April (1703) will be  
a green bull baited, and twenty doggs fight for a  
collar… with other versions of bull-baiting and bear  
baiting. Beginning at two of the clock.”  
The memory of Tothill Fields that haunts the place  
to this day brought humanity to a new low. After  
Oliver Cromwell’s victory at the Battle of Worcester  
in 1651, which ended the Civil War, thousands of  
defeated Scottish soldiers were marched in sub-human  
conditions from the battlefield at Worcester to Tothill  
Fields where an estimated 1,200 of them died from  
disease, starvation or maltreatment en route or were  
executed when they arrived. The “lucky” ones escaped  
death only to be sold as white slaves to merchants  
operating in Guinea or the Caribbean.  
There were far too many bodies to be buried in the  
cemetery of New Chapel, the chapel of ease for St  
Margaret’s Church where Christchurch Gardens  
in Victoria Street is today. Instead the corpses were  
buried in mass graves in Tothill Fields, which almost  
certainly included part of the land that is today’s  
Vincent Square.  
A permanent ‘pest-house’ known as “The Sheds” was  
established by Lord Craven as a lazaretto or isolation  
hospital for victims of the Great Plague when Tothill  
Fields became a burial ground for the dead when  
graveyards overflowed. It became a feared place as  
the ground could not be consecrated under church  
law.  
In the 17th century, people used to resort to a  
“Maze” in these same fields, which, according to  
a contemporary writer, was much frequented in the  
summer-time, the fields being described as “of great  
use, pleasure, and recreation,” to the King’s Scholars  
of Westminster School and neighbours.  
Hollar’s engraving gives a romanticised view of Tothill  
Fields with well-dressed visitors in the foreground and  
a maze in the middle, but among the small figures  
huddled at the back it looks as though a duel was  
taking place. It is possible that the mound, bottom  
right, could be all, or part, of the raised look-out that  
gave rise to the word Toot-hill.  
Today nothing remains to remind residents and  
visitors of Tothill Fields except the name of a road.  
The names “Tute” or Toot or Toot-hill referred long  
ago to a raised look-out post which is known to have  
existed as recently as 1804 when the parish Vestry  
was granted permission to convey “the rubbish in  
the hill in Tothill Fields” to raise the level of a nearby  
burial ground. The hill or mound is commonly thought  
to have been on the curve of Horseferry Road \- where  
the red-coloured blob is on the Roque map above. It  
is perhaps worth a thought as you zoom past in your  
car. Or maybe even a toot.  
56: Edward the Confessor: the good and  
the not so good  
It is impossible to write about  
Thorney Island without mentioning  
(St) Edward the Confessor. Without  
him there may never have been a  
Westminster Abbey as we know  
it. He was born around 1003 in  
Oxfordshire, the son of a French  
mother, Emma of Normandy and  
King Ethelred the Unready (meaning  
poorly advised) of Wessex. He was  
driven into exile to Normandy by the  
Danes. Edward apparently vowed  
that if he returned safely to England  
he would make a pilgrimage  
to Rome. He didn’t make that  
pilgrimage, but was released from  
his vow by the Pope on condition  
that he would re-found a monastery  
for St Peter. This led to him to build  
a new church at Westminster which  
Shrine of (St) Edward the Confessor  
he largely financed by himself from  
his royal revenues and gifts from the nobles. These  
on noble families such as the Godwins had lasting  
days we might call it a sovereign wealth fund.  
political consequences for England. Not to put too  
The Abbey was later reconstructed in the Gothic style  
fine a point on it, if he had produced a successor it  
by Henry III in the 13th century to become the Abbey  
would almost certainly have undermined William the  
we know today. Henry was greatly influenced by  
Conqueror’s claim to the throne and the horrendous  
Edward’s piety and the attraction of his tomb in the  
consequences of his eventual success.  
Abbey which had become a place of pilgrimage.  
The cult of St Edward was greatly fashioned by the  
Edward was known as the Confessor though there is  
determination of Osbert de Clare, Prior of Westminster,  
no evidence that he ever went to confession to a priest  
long after Edward’s death, to have him canonised.  
(unlike future kings such as Richard II and Henry V,  
Osbert was a sort of ecclesiastical spin doctor who  
who did). His piety was not in question, but his failure  
wrote a hagiography of Edward and campaigned in  
to produce an heir and his disproportionate reliance  
Rome for his canonisation, portraying him as a holy162 163man and worker of claimed, but not proven, miracles.  
After initial failures, Edward was eventually canonised  
in 1161 by Pope Alexander III, a few years after de  
Clares’s death. However, canonisation didn’t lead to  
Edward becoming the Patron Saint of England.  
In 1350, another Edward \- King Edward III \- chose an  
early Christian martyr, St George, as the Patron Saint  
of England when he formed the Order of the Garter,  
even though there was no evidence that George ever  
visited England. However, his status as a warrior  
martyr was more in keeping with the spirit of the times  
as endorsed by the battle cry of Shakespeare’s Henry  
V: “Cry Go for Harry, England and St George”.  
The Confessor may have failed to become England’s  
Patron Saint, but his Abbey, which has crowned  
every king since William the Conqueror, has become  
a prime national memory and a huge attraction for  
tourists, especially from overseas. England may no  
longer be the political force it once was, but exploiting  
the legacy of its past has become a new source of  
economic growth.

Victor Keegan, a born and bred Londoner, claims to have  
been doing exactly the same job every day of his working  
life: that is rearranging the 26 letters of the alphabet into  
different combinations while trying to avoid saying the same  
thing twice. It started when he was involved with two joint  
Cambridge and Oxford magazines, Cameo and Image,  
with his brother William (who still writes a regular economics  
column for The Observer after nearly 50 years)  
It gathered pace when he joined The Guardian reporting  
about news, finance, economics, the internet, virtual  
worlds and mobile phones. He had a fortnightly column on  
economics and industry for nearly 25 years, followed by a  
weekly column on the digital revolution. His most satisfying  
creative time was launching the first text message poetry  
competition on The Guardian with colleagues.  
In retirement, he started writing poems and has so far written  
six books on a large range of subjects from the future of the universe to a nun on the London Underground. He  
was a sort of poet in residence at the wonderful Illuminate Rotherhithe event in 2019 and the When the Oak  
Spoke festival at Wadhurst in Kent, also in 2019, plus the London Urban Forest Festival.  
Poetry carried on until he fell in love . . .  
with London. He had lived there most of his life, but it was only years after he had moved with his family  
to Victoria that he became entranced by the history beneath his feet. He was amazed to find that within  
walking distance of their apartment there had been three large prisons, the biggest and most prestigious piano  
manufacturer in the world and next to where Westminster Tube station is today what was claimed to be the  
grandest opera house in Europe was built up to roof level before the money ran out and it had to be dismantled.  
Further research revealed hundreds of other examples which resulted in Vic Keegan’s Lost London (1) and Vic  
Keegan’s Lost London 2 and now this book on Thorney Island.  
More books have probably been written about the small area covered by Thorney Island than anywhere  
else in Britain. This is no surprise since these few acres have been host to Westminster Abbey, two Houses of  
Parliament, Westminster School, a Sanctuary full of criminals and for over 500 years practically all the law  
courts and the Royal Palace from where the whole country was ruled.  
My thanks must go to the dozens and dozens of books I have dipped into, an increasing number of which are  
now online.

Many thanks to Westminster Archives, in St Ann’s Street, a treasure trove of information about the history of  
the whole of Westminster. I am deeply indebted to their ever friendly staff past and present. Thanks also to  
Patterson Joseph, the actor, who brought the life of Ignatius Sancho, the black polymath, to life in the church of  
St Margaret’s where he was married and encouraged me to continue writing when my energy was flagging.  
As always there must be special thanks to Wikipedia, an oasis of calm, preserving the ethos of the original  
internet before it was colonised by corporations. I hope it survives the onslaught of the new AI search engines  
which have given a fresh dimension to search with as yet little known long-term consequences.
